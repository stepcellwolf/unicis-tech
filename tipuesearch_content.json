Predrag is the author of two paperback books : Messenger-Pigeon and Interactive Cyber Security Awareness Program, as well as being published in the magazines, blogger at ResPublica - academic blogging and also he is a Microsoft Certified Trainer and a Lead/External Auditor for ISMS. Today, he is an independent cyber security researcher. Long Bio I have finished my Post-Master (Diplôme d'Ingénieur de specialisation) in Security in Computer Systems and Communications at EURECOM . As well as, visiting/remote lecturer in Faculty Humanistic Studies . I'm affiliated with Master of Cyber Security Studies at the University of Donja Gorica , Podgorica, Montenegro. My Vita -> Much of my research has been about cyber security as part of national security awareness, risk assessment, identity/risk management, cyber defence, cyber risk, cyber insurance, cyber crime, socio-technical aspects, methodological approach to awareness, password attacks, frequently occurring security incidents, threats, etc. My current work focuses on cyber risk and cyber insurance , defining correlation between threats vs. vulnerabilities, and likelihood of impact loss. I'm also interested in techniques and methods for data analysis and data science / mining. Moreover, for everyday tasks usually I use: Emacs , org-mode , LaTeX, Linux ( Lubuntu ); windows 7, FreeMind , GIMP , and many other open source software. Additionally I use for development and for data mining the following: Python , R , Beautiful Soup , IPython and many others. I am very interested in photographing and I own Nikon 80 DSLR, cooking, traveling and skiing. Sometimes, I go to yoga class, DJing - here is the music that I love and the one that I can not live without, and many other things.

When we talk about Balkan region it is actually neither one step further nor one step backwards regarding cyber threats and cyber security. And at the same time progression of ICT is improving the connectivity and its utilities from the rest of the world. For this reason discussing about cyber defense and security capacity in the region is in fact crucial and important topic. However before we continue we have to understand the difference between IT security and cyber security. IT security is to protect business and individual assets, whereas cyber security it involved IT security as well as national, state security and security of Critical Information Infrastructure point of view. To be able to have safer cyber space, we need to take an actions. Such as, ratifying conventions for instance Budapest Convention, moreover, adapting legal framework with international and of course social society needs. Than pursue establishment of National Bodies that will deal with occurrence and the frequency of cyberspace attacks and threats. And last but not least, develop national cyber security strategy. Among the mentioned actions, also important is to take into consideration the general approaches, as multi stakeholders and multi-level approach. Cyberspace could not be 100% secured, therefore each country should introduce national cyber security culture and at the same time raising the awareness level to the weakest link in cyber security - that is the human behaviors. Moreover, when we discuss about the cyber security and defense another important questions should be raised, by providing of course and answers: Who? determines the target of who you are planning to secure. What? determines the content of what to secure. How? is the means by how you are going to secure it. Turning back to Balkan vision toward cyber defense and security, we might say that several countries a much further progressing, such as Slovenia, Croatia, Albania, Montenegro and Bosnia & Herzegovina, in contrast to slowly progressing countries: Macedonia, Serbia and etc. Nevertheless, the region has taken under the umbrella and understood the importance of such topics and for this reason are taking hence actions. Such actions are as we mentioned previously making their legal framework compliance with the international perspectives. And establishing national bodies to react and countermeasure the incident occurred in cyberspace. And finally establishing national cyber security strategy. And in the end I would like to provide recommendation actions that could help other countries in pursuing and capacity building towards cyber defense and security. Such as: 1. Understand cyber defense from a global perspective, don't feel nervous and foolish when it comes to the word \"Cyber\". Use common and simple language that everyone could understand it. 2. Define and implement a national cyber security/defence strategy, followed by cyber security frameworks by supporting it initiatives and international cooperation. 3. Develop public awareness, cyber security culture and education that will touch entire population needs. 4. Improve resilience against cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, hybrid war and cyber warfare by sharing knowledge, documents, continues education and training, military and non-military capabilities. 5. Enforcing ICT infrastructures security in order to obtain confidence and security in the use of ICT. By investing in research and development. 6. And finally, continuance of public meetings and networking are in fact needed and essential on yearly basis for secure cyber space. \"The first step toward encouraging security and defence is awareness, followed by the implementation, acceptance and so forth\"","tags":"misc","title":"Balkans capacity towards cyber defense"},{"url":"http://predragtasevski.com/posts/2015/09/macedonian-cyber-security/","text":"Abstract Information and communication technologies in Macedonia have experienced a phenomenal growth throughout the last decades, which has had a tremendous impact on governmental services' presence in the Internet, as well as on everyday life. Against this background, technologies-based growth introduces new risks and threats to the cyber domain in the country. To respond to those challenges the Macedonian government is pursing the establishment of a national authority to react to cyber attacks that occur, or a Computer Incident Response Team – MKD-CIRT, and the adoption of a National Cybersecurity Strategy. However, it should be taken into account that such tasks are neither easy nor simple. There are several issues that should be considered, for instance: the improvement of the measures for protection of information systems and of the critical infrastructure; the legal and policy framework; the international approach; and the formation of a cybersecurity culture, to name but a few. Simultaneously, considering that Macedonia is a candidate for accession to the EU and NATO, it has to comply with their standards when performing the reforms in the cybersecurity field. The current article briefly introduces the country's steps towards cybersecurity, provides an analysis of the legal, policy and institutional progress achieved, and suggests recommendations that should be considered to ensure safer, secure, trustworthy and resilient cyber space in the country.

This is due to an idiotic incident or I might say stupidity approach of someone, who decided to exploit the vulnerability of wordpress sites on the server where my blog was hosted. Yet, this incident occurred in the middle of this year, and it indeed took me a while to tackle and handle the new blog. Speaking of which the incident, it was perfect timing where I was just thinking of changing and researching which is the most suitable solution to switch from dynamic CMS (Custom Management System) to static one. Why I switched from dynamic to static, I might guess that almost everyone knows the reasons. But let me highlight the most important ones. For instance, static web sites are resistant to the attacks when the intruder requests more then one queries, there is no database in the back-end or on the server needed as requirements, the content of the posts and pages are written in pure markdown or some other plain text format, it is fun - particularly when you need to learn new language or totally new different approach, especially when you could hosted in free, community publicly available services, such as GitHub and many more. Those are just few reasons why I have decided to use and to switch my blog - homepage from dynamic web content management system to static one. Moreover, to switch from dynamic to static, I kind of dig deep into the several static web solutions. However, before I choose the right one, and before checking one by one, I had a requirements list which aims and guide me in selecting and shortening my list. Without any further a do, here are the requirements: - Static web solution. - Python language, because I'm more familiar rather then Ruby, Perl, etc. - Being able and easy to be deployed into GitHub Pages, particularly is because I want it to switch from payed host to a community based one. And most of the nerds and geeks nowadays are hosting there sites and blogs at GitHub Pages. - Be able to write the content with Markdown format, and import and export them from Org-mode format. Because this is the format that I usually use everyday. - Good documentation and to be able to import the content from WordPress to the required format. - Easy to be integrated with bootstrap3 and to be responsive, without any further tackling or need to create theme from stretch. - To be continuously maintained. - Any indeed many others, which I could not recall them at the moment, but anyway feel free to add additional requirements. Worth withstanding, to mention one site which helped and provide me a perfect list of all freely-publicly available static web site generator solutions, StaticGen . The competition taking in mind the above requirements was between Pelican and Nikola . And to be frank with you, I like the Nikola name, mostly because it is Slavic name, however after couple of hours researching I have decided to give it a try to Pelican. Therefore, my first impression of it was that indeed I fell in love with it. Not because it is developed with Python, but also because of the simplicity and the structure of the content using tree approach. Additionally the documentation it-self it is quite good, I say quite because it could be better, but anyway it is well structured. It does provide step-wised methods of how to deploy your blog - pages into several different most popular cloud solutions, and so on. However, in the end for advance futures and advanced theme-ing and so on, you might find it a bit fragile and not enough to prepare you for next steps. Nonetheless, I do not want to give a wrong expression, it is quite well documented and it will provide you nice tips - before you upload your first gh-pages in Github make sure to check the Tips section. At the beginning importing content from the previous system was quite nice done, and it provides you different solutions, such as plugins to import from well known CMS, or you can just import the RSS feeds, which in the end I did it. Anyhow, then you need to choose between tags and slugs what will be the difference and so on. Meantime, you also need to decide which plugins and themes your are going to use. After you configure your pelicanconf.py , don't forget to update the IDs for google analytics and the comments system. In the end, before you upload the content to the github pages make sure you understand or you know GitHub commands, otherwise you will be lost like me first hours. But finally I understood that if I would like to use GitHub for future work, most probably I will need to learn and know my way to deal with it. If you do not know, then you will end-up like me deleting the content, then screwing the GitHub repositories and so on. Anyway, hope that this will help you to decide if you have any doubts of which static web solution you should use, and how to deploy it and indeed, where as well. Hope you enjoy it and I will try my best to keep this blog up-to date and also share much more with you in near future.

December was a last month of 2013, and for sure the best month. Not because of the parties, holidays and vacation that they were coming. But it is because I was selected in a final round of Kaspersky Academy European Round 2014 in Milan, Italy. The conference was a part of CyberSecurity for the Next Generation events that are happening all over the world. The event took place in 11 until 13 of December 2013, in beautiful and unfortunate at that time foggy city Milan, and hosted at Politecnico di Milano. Nevertheless, we had a wonderful time. Before I continue with the presentation of my research paper I would like to thanks the organizers for such a great organization and full and frankly not that busy and indeed interesting agenda. Nice work guys, love you and of course miss you. Turning to research paper that I presented, \"Methodological approach to security awareness\", the presentation is available below as well as my presentation notes. Without any further ado I will let the notes to speak for themself, as well as the presentation and the pictures. Hope that you enjoy the reading. Ladies and gentlemen, dear committee, my name is Predrag Tasevski from Macedonia and currently I'm a post-master student in Eurecom, France. Today I will present you my research study Methodological approach to security awareness. But before we start I would like to share a short story. Previously I was studying MSc in Cyber security in Estonia. When I was in the middle of the studies, in the 2011, it was one year after finished the first year. I went home for the Christmas holidays. At that time I was curious in opening a company in Macedonia. And for this reason I went to Central register office. When I reached the room number 10 I knocked on the door. Once, two, three times, and still there was no answer. I push the door and I entered in empty room full of 6 computers. I shouted few times, however there was no answer. So I started to watch the screens. Unlikely from Estonia, frankly in Macedonia people love paper-work. Indeed, in the bureaus there where open documents and the computer's ware unlocked. Usually, I always I have with me an external hard drive… Then the good side and bad side of me come out .… It took me a few minutes to decide,… and likely the good side of me won. After 30 minutes I was able to get the answers. Let us just stop for a second and thing what I could do with this data …. Could you imagine how reach I would be nowadays if I backup the data… While I was on the way back home, I started to think why people are so careless about the information. In reality it just takes one second to lock the computer. Why people coupled with human factor are actually the weakest link in security? And therefore for this reason, we introduce you this study. Today we will discuss the problem statement and related work. Coupled with the current awareness level. Secondly, methods and approached that we have introduced in this study and the curriculum. Last but not least, we will present the results of the syllabus as a consequence of the implementation in schools, universities, private and public organizations. And finally we will conclude. Numerous amounts of awareness programs exist in the last 20 years. However their approaches and methods are different. Up to now almost all the academic effort in information security training has concentrated on solving the technical and policy aspects, rather than designing security systems to take into account the human factor. The human factor is being the most vulnerable threat in the system, and it could jeopardize the overall efficiency of the organization and nation. Lastly, few of them have the questionnaire quizzes implemented. The ideas for the awareness program we have implemented are usually not new, but the uniqueness of our awareness program lies in the style of communication, the systematic approach of the targeted groups and the content delivered. Other unique factors are the baseline survey and questionnaire quiz, and lastly the topic adviser. We believe that no other previously related work as mention in this study has used such systematic approach, methods and targeted groups. There are three systematical target groups in the syllabus: basic, advance and management. Each part contains certain number of modules, divided into units, which are pursued into separate curriculum. In fact the idea of the target groups is to elevate the awareness level of three different types of groups of information security. We emphasize that the weakest element is human behavior, followed by the socio-technical aspect. Please bear in mind, that this syllabus does not cover the legal aspects. The study provided the entrance for participants only with the Basic curriculum. The focus is to examine the response of the prior concern about safety and knowledge of protection of IT assets compared to the scores earned. In total we had around 1000 participants, from 11 to 63 years old and around 700 of them where male and the rest female. Most of the them use the computers either at home or work. In the content of how they want to get education about the IT security is that around 430 answered through Online training. Turning to the current awareness level before they entered the course is in fact that only 400 of them were somewhat knowledgeable of how to secure their assets. Also another interesting fact is that a greater number of the participants are least concerned about protecting their mobile devices. In comparison with the current awareness level we also demonstrate the average percentage score gained in each unit. Subsequently it allows us to pin-point modules which participants are more and less knowledgeable. So as to take tailored measurements for future actions. For instance Network & Internet Security is the most knowledgeable, rather than Physical security. Finally, the threats to cybersecurity are constantly evolving. Thus we need to ensure that not only the specialist who are protecting IT systems get a proper awareness education, but also the basic, everyday users and managers should too. Every manager can be a user, but every user can not be a manager. Thereby, only significant changes in user perception, culture and education can effectively reduce the number of information and cybersecurity breaches. Consequently this will raise the awareness level of the human factor in using technologies in everyday life. The strength of our study lies in the results and evidence of implemented syllabus and it improve everyday work and usage of technologies. We believe that this approach could be implemented effectively in private, public, military, nations, etc. without a significant degradation in performance. As well as future studies should examine broader views on policy and legal aspects. Although I did not win, however let me just remind the others that we are all winners. There were around 60 papers submitted and only 15 were selected for finale round. We should be proud of our self. And of course each one of us did a perfect job in presenting own work. Hope that you all will continue in this path, as well as to see you soon. Friendship and networking that we had there is my gift from others and Kaspersky. Thank you once again. Congrats to the winners. Here is a short note from Kaspersky about the conference, CyberSecurity in Milan .

However, this year the weather surprised all the participants of Stockholm Internet Forum 2014 . Although it is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, it was even more with rising sun every day. Especially coming from Nice where the weather was under storm, and sunny and long days in Stockholm were unforgettable. Before I continue with description and the nature of this year SIF, first would like to apologize for late post – I was under busy with examination, second would like to thank the organization for selecting me as a valuable participant. Being in Stockholm for the second time it is a privilege. And indeed, this year SIF surprised me with the invitation. Usually the organizers are selecting each year new participant. From their explanation only 10% of previous year participants are invited where the rest are new. Consequently, there were around 450 participants, from different countries in this year SIF14. Nonetheless, it was an event for great opportunities for networking and meeting interesting people, or see the rear ones from the previous year. Speaking of which the event and the panel discussions I might say that I'm a bit disappointed, because of the repeating of the participant from SIF13. Another point that I would like to stress out regarding the event is that in this event the participants are not only a hacktivists, policy makers, whistleblowers, activities, NGO, etc., but also companies and so forth. I love the idea of selecting for each panel to have one enterprise represent, however bear in mind that people will might exploit this and take and pursue a totally different aspect of the discussion. Therefore, I suggest for the organization to select wisely the enterprise panelists. For instance, make sure that the topic and the theme of the panels are emphasized and understood by the wide audience, as well as that the chair man and the panelists will control the floor and that the topic will not go outside of content. This is due to this event, some panel discussions were totally misunderstood by the audience and indeed some participants were frustrated, for instance me, but also many others. Furthermore, coming back to the selection of percentage of the participant. I frankly love the idea that you like to bring different audience and different people each year event, however in my opinion and as well as from other that we discussed during the event is that will be much better that from the 10% is either 15-20%. This is due to fact that most if the time these topics and events only and usually bring new topics and questions, and not give answers to them. So in this respect you will have a continuing discussions and most probably some answers, coupled with outcome. Also I would like to take an opportunity to respond to the participant that were emphasizing the participation of one of the hot topic and indeed well known person, today – Edward Snowden. In respect to their request where is Snowden and so on, I would like to point out few things: first in international law it is firstly impossible to bring him in Sweden because of his status in Russia; moreover there is no need for him to take participation in the event where we talk about freedom of Internet, as well as the espionage, privacy, policy, etc. To sum, again thanks to the organization for inviting me once again to the event. Second, by taking into account the above suggestions, personally thing that the event will be more progressive, as well as proactive by having outcome. Further, bring people, panelists which are wisely selected compliance to the topic and theme of the event and/or discussion. In the end, looking forward seeing you in the next year, as well hope that I will be taking place this time as one of panelist. Where not only that I could contribute with the discussion but also bring some new important questions in the podium.

Please bear in mind, that the author is conducting research in this field, therefore in few months there will be more articles about cyber-risk and so forth. Nevertheless, hope that the below will guide you, and will give you better understanding for risk assessment. Internet has become as essential part of risks in every organization. Despite all the malicious code and alerts, we use it increasingly. Therefore, risk assessment is a critical part of risk management in each organization that deals within the IT infrastructure. Traditionally, the focus has been related to natural hazards. However, risk assessment has received much attention in the past decade. Subsequently it is a primary task in enterprises and it is widely considered a key reason for improving an organization's IT performance. In content to risk assessment as a part of risk management, additionally we have the criminality and unlawful exploitations of the Internet. Accordingly, [1] provides a partial approach to cyber-risk as a vital feature of risk assessment. Consequently, there are three different approaches that the studies have tended to focus on, such as, economical approach [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], cyber-risk coupled with risk management and insurance [1, 9, 10], and game theory [11, 6, 7]. Moreover, we define risk when the chosen action or activity will lead to organizational loss. In addition, risk is the likelihood that something wrong or/and bad will happen and it will cause harm to the organizational information asset, or lead to the entire loss of the asset. In risk, vulnerability is a weakness that could be used to jeopardize or cause harm. Threat is anything (artificial or act of nature) that has the potential to cause harm to organizational information assets [11]. Also, the chance that a threat will use a vulnerability to cause damage creates a risk for the organizations. When a threat uses vulnerability to inflict damage, it has an impact. In the context of information security, the impact is a loss of availability, integrity and confidentiality. Similarly, to information security, in cyber security the additional impacts are: non-repudiation, authentication, information systems importance and criticality according to state Critical Information Infrastructure / Critical Infrastructure. Other possible losses can occur too, such as loss of income and loss of life, etc. It is very important to point out that it is impossible to find all risks, nor is it possible to drop all risks [12]. To sum, above we have provide the readers with basic concept and merely approaches to risk assessment. Additionally for further readings, we suggest you to do follow-up from the references below.

In details, [1, 2] each year number of users using Internet per 100 inhabitants is increasing for near 10 percent. In the other hand, people that are not using the Internet is correspondingly dropping. Along the line, the access to Internet, i.e. cyberspace has become a vital step in everyday life. We connect to Internet through various of devices. In view of this, we expose data, along with hatred feelings about other rights. Therefore, cyberspace has a vital impact in human rights, privacy and right to freedom of speech. For this reason, in this essay we will discuss and provide the guidance to the protection of data in cyber space under certain conditions. And subsequently, we will highlight the pros and cons. Moreover, the definition of cyber space is as a global, borderless and nautral space offering an environment that consists of many participants with the ability to influence each other. Particularly to Froomkin [3] is that Internet could increase communication among all citizens. As well as, it could increase citizens participation in decision making processes. Likewise could increase the legitimacy of governments and governance structures. However, opposite view for cyberspace, or in other words \"new romantic\" [4] is that is misleading for the development of a clear vision from a legal prospective. Also, the broader concept of ‘right to access' it may be limited and interfere with human rights in cyberspace in the plurality of state and non-state actors. Additionally, it is clear that the Internet provides unparalleled opportunities for the promotion and advancement of human rights, most centrally the right to seek, receive and impart information [5]. As well as, raises a difficult questions of how to simultaneously protect potential competing rights. Obviously without question it is increasingly difficult to define human rights and responsibilities in cyberspace, noted Mansell [6]. Yet, when we discuss the human right to importance of security, bear in mind that always it refers to national and private security. Anyway, one very good example and discussion about the freedom and security in cyberspace was in May on Stockholm Internet Forum 2013 [7], where I was personally presented as participant. Particularly, we discussed the relationship between freedom and security in cyberspace, where the panelists gave their opinions emphasizing the need to keep the Internet free to make sure that it continues to be an enabler for economic growth, freedom of speech and the access to information. On the contrary, others emphasized the need to fight crime on the Internet by implementing existing laws and not necessarily by introducing new legislation contradictory to already laid down principles and norms. Turning to security, they underline the need to define security of what for whom. Explicitly, some of the participants do not feel safe on the Internet, and for that, there is need for law enforcement to improve their capabilities to fight crimes against individuals committed online. However, these measures should not limit the freedom of expression or basic human rights. In conclusion, we have presented above different points of view regarding the human rights coupled within the protection of data in cyberspace. And with this, we can summarize that actually it is not an easy task to give a guidance for human right to the protection of data in cyberspace. Especially that this issue has been discussed in past few years, without any resolution and so forth. Nevertheless, we have to keep in mind that by pursuing security coupled with freedom always leads to awkward risk. Reference [1] Internet users per 100 inhabitants 2001-2011, 2012.

The location of the camp was in a such a beautiful area. My eyes could not stop looking for something, such as either it was the top of the mountain, or the Plavsko lake, or even the green hills and valleys. Anyhow, let me return to the main point here. Firstly I will like to share a couple of history background of Regional Euro Atlantic Camp REACT , organized by ALFA Center Montenegro . First REACT camp took place in 2008, since then it takes place every year, until now six years. The best and intriguing part of this camp is that each year the venue of the event is in different place, therefore the participants have a change to meet the beauty of Montenegro. The idea in behalf of the organizers is very good, and I do support them in this matter. Sometimes Montenegro routs could be a very heavy for the drivers, however still this beauty should be exposed to the rest of the world. Additionally, each year the number of participants varies depending on the applications. However, this year there where participants from 25 different countries, which make is in total 75 participants from elsewhere, such as, Balkans countries, Ex-Soviet Union countries, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic and many others. Turning to the agenda of REACT 2013, it was quite densely deployed, with lectures, panel discussions, etc. Although it was heavy still the best side was the picnic adventures and cultural evenings. Please feel free to see the pictures below of the post. Secondly, I would like to take a time to concentrate more on the issue of cyber security. During the event the speakers where representative of governments from sixteen countries, as well as NGOs, media, students, researchers, among the others. Mostly, the topics where concentrating on intention to see the pros and cons of join to NATO, where indeed the countries from this region have in mind. However, when it comes to the goals of NATO, and new threats, such as cyber threats, cyber crime coupled with strategies, framework and so on, only one speaker it emphasized the importance of cyber security as one of the greatest risk now a day and in future, of course. I will not delay too much, as you might all unravel it was the USA Deputy Chief of Mission in Montenegro, Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones was very precise in his speech, moreover he mentioned the importance of infrastructure as well as the stability and security in Balkan region. I would like to cite one of the lectures, Mr. Petric he said \"Together we are stronger!\". How the days go by, I was just wondering and always trying to ask questions about the cyber security, and the importance of this issue, however, most of the speakers where no that specialized or somehow not interested of in fact important unit of integration requirements in NATO. Additionally, I was a moderator to a topic Kosovo open or close? The question was which topics, fields are close or open, regarding the Kosovo as a new country in the region. In short summary, please feel free to see the pictures below and I hope that in future to REACT Camp we will have much more discussions and panels and topics about the new threats that we are facing. Likewise, I always say, no matter how much we pour money in infrastructure and security, still the weakest chain will be the human factor, because it is not a aware of the importance of cyber security. Consequently, we will have to keep in mind that this issue and importance of cyber security is in benefits to wide security, economy and political aspects, by process of joining and integrating the region to the path of NATO.

And of course this question was almost always couples with the question if we do penetration testing does it means that we are doing as well as vulnerability assessment? In this content, I have decided to share with you the meanings, such as, methods, approaches of each process, as well as a further reading – papers, articles and books – that could help you to distinguish this difference and of course broaden your views. With no further do, firstly I would like to make sure that we are clear with the empirical terminologies used: Vulnerability Assessment is the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing (or ranking) the vulnerabilities in a system 2 . Penetration Testing - occasionally pentest , is a method of evaluating computer and network security by simulating an attack on a computer system or network from external and internal threats 1 . Mostly, the above two terms are confused with each other. In other words, penetration testing is necessary to determine the true attack footprint of your environment, assets, and so fort. For this reason the the difference is highlighted and fully explained below in separated sections. Vulnerability Assessments It is used and of course it is necessary to discovering potential vulnerabilities throughout the environment in for instance, organization, company, or even asset. Usually there different scope for such an task, nonetheless sometimes does work only by available automatic tools or through manual test as well. Usually, and please bare this in your mind that full exploitation of systems and services is not generally in scope for a normal vulnerability assessment task. Most-likely, systems are typically enumerated and evaluated for vulnerabilities and testing can be done with or without authentication. Additionally, important in fact for the management staff is the actionable reports, thus reports contain details about the mitigation strategies, for instance, applying missing patches, correcting insecure system configurations and among the others [3]. The steps to vulnerability assessments are [4]: Cataloging assets and resources in a system Assigning quantifiable value and importance to the resources Identifying the vulnerabilities or potential threats to each resource And mitigating or eliminating the most serious vulnerabilities for the most valuable resources Penetration testing Pen testing is coupled, or in other words it expands upon vulnerability assessment efforts by introducing exploitation into the matrix. The main purpose is to allow the business to understand if the mitigation strategies are actually working as it was expected. Furthermore, pen testing requires a higher skill level than is needed for vulnerability analysis. Particularly, this means that the price for penetration test will be much higher than that of a vulnerability analysis [3]. Also, there are two primary types of pen tests: White box, it uses vulnerability assessment and other predisclosed information, and Black box, it performed with very little knowledge of the target systems and it is left to the tester to perform their own reconnaissance, to gather information as much as possible.. Usually, pen tests follow these steps [4]: Determination of scope Targeted information gathering or reconnaissance Exploit attempts for access and escalation Sensitive data collection testing Clean up and final reporting Conclusion The key difference between those two is that pen testing goes beyond the level of identifying vulnerabilities and goes through the process of exploitation, privilege escalation, and maintaining access to the target system. Where on the other hand, vulnerability assessment provides a better picture of any existing flaws in the system with out the measuring the impact of the flaws to the system. However, vulnerability assessment carefully identifies and quantifies all the vulnerabilities in a non-invasive manner [5]. Reference \"Glossary\" . ISACA.

It was my first time experience with Lenovo. Previous experience was with HP, and in fact I'm sure that I do not want to get into it, as well as even to remember it or even to mention it. Anyhow, coming back to the Thinkpad, at the first I just fall in love with the keyboard as well as with the red mouse pad, also the solid structure and the black color. Like they always say laptop for the underground/hacking and indeed nerd people, as me. Unfortunately, recent event or I might say events made me to write this post, where usually I do not write this kind of content to share. However, let me start from the begging to least event as follows. First event occurred after four months where suddenly after watching the movie the left or the right speaker stopped working. I was not aware of this occurrence so I have continue to use the laptop, for music and for any thing of course. But after one or to week the laptop was mute. Just one note that I was only using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS , Linux, so I thought that it might happened while I was updating and upgrading the kernel and the drivers. After one week of troubleshooting, with forums, ubuntu ask, kernel FAQ, finally we came to conclusion in IRC channel of ubuntu that this might be the hardware problem. So I took the laptop to the support service where I actually both it. The support was very friendly and of course they did understand my problem. They have even try in front of me, but with no sound at all. Meanwhile, while I was there we also spotted smudge on the corner of the display. Ok, perfect, I'm already there so let us fix it two in one. Due to the missing parts of display the support guy just manage to order only the speakers, and he told me to give him a call in one month to order the display as well. Usually Lenovo alloweds one part per month to be changed, nevertheless better something than nothing. After the speakers fixing issue the engineer told me that the plastic where the speakers where it was kind of malted. Surprisingly, I did not know what to say, I was listening music and loud as anyone else. Nevertheless, this problem was fixed. After one month I have called him to order display and in 7 days hi send me an email to bring the laptop to change it. Perfect, lets do it! Finally I have got the new display installed without any spots. So I asked the guy how it did happened, was there kind of damage or something else. His response was very clear during the assembling of the parts, putting them in order they most probably scratch the display on the back. Uhhh, this can happened, of course, but why to me. Either I just have bad luck or I'm just not too good with technology. Last but not least, some how after few months the spot appeared again, almost on the same place. Uffffff…, not again… Final problem just happened today, while I was at school writing homework and of course working on the research paper, the battery went out. So I plug the laptop into the desk at school, but somehow does not charge at all. Yes, so my charger is death or maybe the entire laptop too. Just one note, before you start wandering how I did write this post, simple it is on the blackberry tablet. Thank you blackberry for such a great present. Coming back, as some of you currently know I'm outside of where I purchased the laptop, so this adds plus effort to find a support or service for Lenovo in France. Being honest, the entire site of Lenovo is with really bed information, and also does not helps you how you should proceed with this problem. First thing that came into my mind is to check if I still have the warranty. After struggling of typing the information through smart phone, I see that the warranty of the laptop just expired one day ago. Nice, uhuuu, I'm so bloody lucky. In the few days, I will just need to get use to the tablet, as well as smart phone. In conclusion, I just want to emphasis why Lenovo will be my first and of course my last laptop, or even any hardware from Lenovo, because of the above occurrence. Also, like we usually say, the giant manufactures are always producing products to expire after the warranty. So indeed, Lenovo you are doing a hell of a good job. Hopefully if you continuous in this path you will end of hell of a unsatisfied customers like me. Sorry Lenovo for writing such a bed words about your production, but please put yourself into my shoes and position. I'm hell out frustruated. Of course I'm sick of buying laptop every year. Nevertheless, from know one I should start searching for right one, to fall in love. If you have any suggestions please share them below.","tags":"misc","title":"First time Lenovo, hopefully for sure the last time"},{"url":"http://predragtasevski.com/posts/2013/10/belgrade-security-forum-2013-session-7-assuring-cyber-security-in-the-western-balkans-and-the-rest-of-europe/","text":"A few months ago I have received the invitation letter from administration of Belgrade Security Forum, within goal of inviting me to be a speaker in one of the break out sessions. In particular the session topic is: Assuring Cyber-Security in the Western Balkans and the Rest of Europe. And of course, I have accepted the invitation. Speak of which, the Belgrade Security Forum has been in past few years. This – 2013 year was the third in the row event. And with it, we have continue the talk from the previous year session about cyber security: Cyber War and Cyber Crime: Responding to the Governance Challenges . Turning to this year session, we had a very good chance to boost the enthusiasm from other panel discussion where chairman – Richard Thomson called me in between the discussion of Helsinki Plus 40: Strengthening the Security Community to Meet Current Security Challenges. Where he raise the issue of what and if it is possible with one click that someone could stop the energy, power supply or even telecommunication systems. And, my answer was very straightforward, indeed it is! This was a very good spur of inspiration of our breakout session. Together with other speaker we came to conclusion that the best way to go ahead and to have an effective discussion is to open the most important questions relating to cyber security: Who? What? and How? But before further to the answers the above question, I would like also to mention that the speakers where kind of divided, in a good sense where we came from different regions as well as specialized fields in cyber security. In details, Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones was in related fields in government issues and challenges in cyber security. Where on other hand, I was a representative from the Wester Balkan region representative. Furthermore, Alexander Klimburg was more concentrating of different stakeholder, in other words multi stakeholders approach. Where last but not least, Jovan Kurbalija was in diplomacy, civil society and information technology. And finally, the moderator of the session was Vladimir Radunović , who manage to create a nice vibe between the speakers and the audience from the beginning until the end of the session. For more details of the session please follow the Breakout session report: Session 7: Assuring Cyber-Security in the Western Balkans and the Rest of Europe . For more information of the issues that we follow and given answers are available on the Agenda . From left to right: Vladimir Radunović, Predrag Tasevski, Jovan Kurbalija, Alexander Klimburg and Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones Also I would like to make some quick notes on the main cyber threats and possible effects that are linked to Western Balkan region. The most known and presented cyber threats are among the cybercrime. For instance in one hand are: employee fraud, minor and child pornography; using of mobile telephones and smartphones as tools to commit other crime; identity theft and credit card fraud. Where on the other hand are among the political, moral, ethical and other motivation reasons. Such as, web-based attacks, mostly committed by defacement or denial-of-service attacks. Then we have phising and spoofing social networking sites. Where the possible effects are for instance for individuals loss of money, and of course political or ethical doctrine. Moreover, awareness of roles and responsibilities of different actors, such as government, regulators, industry and civil society of risk are taken into consideration only the implementation of law. For instance, data protection law and so on. Turning to the industry and civil society is almost the same, although some of them are implementing the very known standards, such as ISO 27001 and so on. However, is this enough? The roles and responsibilities are only described in the data protection law and criminal law. Unfortunately, it is not carried out by the framework or even a strategy. Likelihood, awareness level in Western Balkans presented by my paper back book that I have conducted last year, Interactive Cyber Security Awareness Program Cyber Security Awareness Program . This book outlines the survey done around 1000 participants, from 11 to 63 years old. In diversity of carries, such as schools, universities, private and public organizations. In total we had 35% people using computers/internet from home and 26% from office. In particular and most interesting figures for us are results about the knowledge of protecting their IT assets, and in details: 16% are very knowledgeable, least knowledgeable are 13% and last but not least somewhat knowledgeable are 40%. Therefore from the results presented we can see that awareness level among the end users is vary. Coming to the end, if we want to make sure the involvement of end users in raising trust and securing the cyberspace we firstly have to start from strategy, than legal framework, followed by implementation, and so on. However, when it comes to step to get done by governments should be as follows: Develop and create strategy framework for Cyber-security, in particular, not to cover the area only of cyber crime, but also how to mitigate happened incidents. Rewrite and review the cyber crime law and data protection law. Create NGO or NPO that will deal not only for a concrete country but of course the entire region, as well. In the end I have noted that some countries in Wester Balkans do not have yet either, CERT – Critical Emergency Response Team nor CIRT – Critical Incident Response Team. Therefore, this action should be taken as soon as possible. In summary, hope that the above notes will take effect, as well as will raise the awareness of the important in fact issue. Therefore we have to be simple and follow just simple three steps: Strategical plan which will aim in business continuity. Partnership between Groups, such as government, private and civil. As well as to provide awareness on the share bases. Education the public, where we need to take an action of re-informing the school materials, and to provide the young generations guide of how to protect in cyber space and skills. Thank you to the participant, speakers, guest, organizers and everyone for such a lovely stay in Belgrade.

Among the topics, also we have touched the cyber security, surveillance, importance of information security coupled with critical information infrastructure and critical infrastructure. Once Alex Levin has said – \"The reason there is so little crime in Germany is that it's against the law.\" – What a hack he was talking? Was he right or wrong? For this reason, the SIF was held this year with more than 94 different countries participants, from all over the world. And indeed, it was one of the best conference organized so far. Nevertheless the number of differential participants let the talks and the conference topics just to flow. Even that the four days of talking was not enough. However, this was just a start, or for someone the beginning of an idea due to the poverty of our thoughts. The opening speech was by Carl Bildt where he presented in fact an importance of digital revolution, African development through connectivity, political debates for freedom of Internet. In addition, he gave a couple of great examples, such as legislations of blocking sites in Russia, violations of human rights in Syria, Vietnam among the others. Also, he noted the security importance of cyber security, where security should be thought but of course should not be used in purpose to limit the human rights. One very good quote, even after two weeks from the conference I still have it in my head, is *\"Free societies are strong societies\" . Last but not least, was that we should take an examples from the leading nations of ICT, such as, Sweden, where the security coupled with human rights are presented on Internet. Frankly, in the opening session we have touched the issue with surveillance and software used for this purpose, coupled with the viability of digital divide popular in Africa and among others. Moreover, we have purse the issue of Internet jurisdiction projects, as well as that we have to boost the awareness of regulations united with the important factor to increased the civil societies in freedom. For more info please visit the summaries notes from the session, Opening session . To continue with the first session again we have to come back some example of the above issue, surveillance, where Mexico has CCTV in private sector for 3 to 4 years. Among the surveillance we have discuss the issue during the riots in London, Syria and Panama as a recent examples where they have shutdown the mobile phone network. Additionally, point in some countries is that people do trust the law enforcement in privacy, where opposite such as in Pakistan they trust only the companies, and not law enforcement agencies. Moreover, hate speech, digital freedom and democracy of freedom was carried out, along with how the law works on Internet with civil societies and that the police need to do their own job. Nevertheless, the note was that vocabulary of cyber security is missing, and it should become a national security and of course the security is a huge problem. This problem is done due to the lack of new laws, by definition of what we mean by a single law treaty. Whom we should secure? What should be asked? In sentence of security importance, civil society. We really need a cyber security strategy, by introducing the legislation and laws throughout experience. In spite of vocabulary e should define and terms, such as, hacktivism and cyberterrorism . One important note was mentioned that we do not want global cyber security law. For more info of the session please visit the following link Reconciling freedom and security in cyberspace . As we mentioned above the frustration was between the west and developing countries in sentence of digital divide. Also one note was that Sweden people trust to the government agencies, as well as that e-voting system in Sweden will help ICT to boost. The session where split into three parts: 1A Global security and human rights in the internet age 1B Distributed security in a national context 1C Free and secure communication in a multinational context . Next day, the second day of the forum (SIF13) we have touched a facts about the free and open Internet and open communications. The second day I will remember forever for speech of the famous Cuban blogger Yoani Sánchez, which said very good quote \"Cuba Internet on Internet\" or another one is that if your relatives or you personally travel to Cuba bring the old and unused gadgets with you and leave them in Cuba or just give them, rather than you should just dispose them or throw them into the trash. For more info please visit the Summaries 2013 page . In conclusion, I might say that the SIF 13 was very successful, as well as very important questions and topics were discussed. However, we should concentrate for the next year forum on more specific topics, either freedom or only a security. It is very difficult when we speak about freedom coupled with security. Does two topics are very linked and fragile. In the end, I would like to thank a lot to the organizers, .SE , Ministry for Foreign Affairs – Sweden and SIDA .

Many scholars, technologists, and social critics believe that these changes and the Internet, in particular, are transforming economic and social life [1]. In the past few years, the scholars have done many researches to make a conclusion of difference in psychological and social tend of the Internet to the citizens. Therefore, the term \"digital divide\" is the gap that exists between those who have access to electronic and Information Technology – Internet and those who do not [2]. Whereby the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) set up could result in an order of restricting the universal access to the Internet. And representing a barrier to European development as an information, knowledge and technology society. In other words, could lead to the censorship of online content and control-restriction to the Internet's freedom, by intimidation the growth of electronic business, cultural exchange, as well as digital creativity. In order to safe the Internet and to provide shelter to digital divide culture we will have to take actions. Introduction Enormous continuing and boosting usage of information and communication technologies in an economic inequality between groups, broadly construed, in terms of access and knowledge has created the term digital divide. Additionally, divide inside countries also could refer to individuals, households, business and geographical areas at different socioeconomic and other demographic levels. On one hand the Internet is changing the average citizens. As much as on the other hand the other technologies, such as: telephone, TV, mobile phones, etc. The main idea and purpose was to aid to and benefit the science, engineering, and business. However, many scholars, technologists, and social critics believe that these changes and the Internet, in particular, are transforming economic and social life [1]. In the past, the scholars have done many researches to make a conclusion of difference in psychological and social tend of the Internet to the citizens. Therefore, the term \"digital divide\" is the gap that exists between those who have access to electronic and Information Technology – Internet and those who do not [2]. Moreover, interesting is to point out that to break the gap between the digital divide the scholars and societies have created a new approach and technology for delivering laptop per child. The project name is one laptop per Child and significant fact is that as of 2011 there were over about 2.4 million XO laptops delivered elsewhere [4]. Whereby the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) could result in an order of restricting the universal access to the Internet. And representing a barrier to European development as an information, knowledge and technology society. In other words, could lead to the censorship of online content and control-restriction to the Internet's freedom, by intimidation the growth of electronic business, cultural exchange, as well as digital creativity. Therefore, in this article we have introduced the readers within the basic concept of digital divide. In addition we illustrate to the readers a map of digital divide and example countries that have stress out the digital divide. In contrast to digital divide we would emphasis on the secret negotiations of ACTA agreement. Moreover, why we should care about it, as well as in order to safe the Internet what kind of actions we should take into consideration. At least we deliver to the readers a conclusion. Digital divide As we mentioned previously it is a term to determine the gap that exists between those who have access to electronic and Information Technology – Internet and those who do not [1]. Thereby in the next subsection we introduce the readers within the concept and basic approach of determining and criteria to define the digital divide. Least we also provide the example country of digital divide. Concept The main concept and criteria of digital divide is shown below [3]: ​1. Subjects of connectivity, or who connects: individuals, organizations, enterprises, schools, hospitals, countries, etc. ​2. Characteristics of connectivity, or which attributes: demographic and socio-economic variables, such as income, education, age, geographic location, etc. ​3. Means of connectivity, or connectivity to what: fixed or mobile, Internet or telephony, digital TV, etc. ​4. Intensity of connectivity, or how sophisticated the usage: mere access, retrieval, interactivity, innovative contributions. ​5. Purpose of connectivity, or why individuals and their cohorts are (not) connecting: reasons individuals are and are not online and uses of the Internet and ICTs. Example One of the best example of digital divide is a North Korea. The broadband infrastructure is with optical fiber links up to 2.5Gbits/s [5]. Additionally the Internet in North Korea is more or less is recalled as \"Intranet\", because of implementation of the Kwangmyong network, in English \"walled garden\" [6]. The most significant fact was the news have spread information that one of the most known torrent sites has been moved to and relocated in North Korea, March 4 2013. However this information was no correct. For more details please refer to the following source [7]. Nevertheless the above are just simple examples and in the Figure 1 we have illustrated you with the map of digital divide. ACTA: Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement has been negotiated from 2007 through 2010 by the United states, the European Union, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Singapore, Morocco, Japan and South Korea. And it has been signed 8 of 11 agreements in October 2011. Moreover, in October 2012 it was ratifies by Japan as well [8]. In addition in Figure 2 we have illustrated you the map of ACTA countries involved in drafting the convention. Why should you care? When we look over the both maps we can come to conclusion that the strongest countries that has less digital divide is the ones who has drafted the convention of ACTA. So we should care, because of the process how it was negotiated, indeed in secret. And the first text was officially released in 2010. It has been roundup within eight closed-doors negotiations. As well as the provisions, where the new IP enforcement measures that raise potential concerns for users free speech, privacy, ability to innovate and due process rights. And finally, the enforcement it creates a new ad-hoc institution, an \"ACTA Committee\", constituting non-elected members to oversee ACTA implementation and interpretation with no legal obligation to the transparent in their proceedings [8]. Digital divide vs ACTA Anyhow, when we compare digital divide versus ACTA agreement we can see that they overlap into one opposite directions. Such as explained in the below table: Digital divide ACTA Access to ICT – Internet Restriction to Internet Freedom of speech Censorship and control-restriction to freedom Economy growth Privacy Culture exchange N/A Demoralizing: the economy, culture exchange, digital creativity Digital creativity N/A Conclusion In short summary is we have introduced the reader with the terminology of what is digital divide coupled with examples. As well as the linked connection between the two topics, digital divide versus ACTA agreement. Therefore, we come to the conclusion is that indeed the ACTA convention is bullying the digital divide.

Not only in Europe, but also in South-East European region as well. The following international event was organized by PanEuropa Bulgaria and it was supported by NATO. Furthermore, I was invited to take a participation as a speaker on the panel discussion Collective Cyber Defence – The Role of Newer Members and Opportunities for Specialization of Bulgaria in the Alliance Questions and answers. In details, the event main points ware to highlight the need for specialization of each member state in terms of the principles of Smart Defense and the joint participation in future military operations. Moreover, the event had splendid video addressing in the opening session of Neelie Kroes, the Vice – President of European Commission. Emphasizing the current online spying crisis as well as the importance of cyber security strategy. In additional, she highlighted the importance of new legal threats, information norms coupled to boost the trust among the Europe. As well as, that the weakest link in the chain should be able to raise and boost the awareness, coupled with the future investments in research and innovations, and projects. Regarding the collective cyber defense panel discussion, I was delighted to be speaker with such strong extensive and experienced experts from different fields. Such as private, public, academy and business sectors. Speaking of which, the moderator of the panel was Prof. Veselin Tselkov, D. Sc., Member of the Board, Commission for Personal Data Protection in Bulgaria. The lectures where: unfortunately Col. Associate Prof. Dr. Stoyan Balabanov, Director, Institute for Defense, Ministry of Defense Bulgaria, was not able to attend the panel, however we had representative from MoD. Also from Bulgaria was Zlatogor Minchev from Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Bulgaria. From Macedonian was Dr. Metodi Hadji-Janev (LtC), Assistant Prof., Military Academy \" General Mihailo Apostolski\", Skopje, Macedonia. From business prospective I was the presenter of CyberSecurity.mk copmany, based in Macedonia. In addition, Mr. Robert Griffin, Director Business Development – Security Systems, RSA. From all the above, we also had video addressing from Mr. Detlef Puhl, Senior Advisor at the Emerging Security Challenges Division, NATO Headquarters, and Mr. Philippe Roggeband, Security Sales Business Development Manager, EBG EMEAR, Cisco Systems. However, due to the security measures in the building where the event was held the video addressing was interrupted. Nevertheless, here is my short presentation notes. Cyberspace has become one of the most essential and distinguished bridge between government and their inhabitants. Thus, the people are able to get access to government services 24/7, as well as their life becomes more easier. However, all in this has led to advance of producing cyberspace to be vulnerable, coupled with information's that should not be available to others. For this reason I would like to share three important points that are fundamental to emphasis when we discuss about the Cyber defense in general. First, we have to understand and highlight the difference between Cyber Security vs IT Security. Second, it is the important to boost the awareness level tailored to national level, social society, private sector and indeed multistakeholder cooperation in the region. Last but not least, we have to brake the lack of communications between the neighboring countries and to create a trusted, same level, and collaboration of cyber security. Where national agencies and parties should work together. Without further ado, first the main goal of IT security is to protect information from a wide range of threats in order to ensure business continuity, reduce business damages and maximize return on investments and business opportunity. Likewise the cyber security is protecting Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) systems and Critical Infrastructure (CI). However the most important protection element in IT security is to reduce business risk to accepted levels and the protection of entire information and information systems essential to the organizations. Alternatively, cyber security aims at assuring critical IT service for CI and CII on accepted levels, in addition to the protection of critical information. In other words the security objective determiner in information security is an organization's business process, while in cyber security it is for the entire state. Emphasizing that states may have different or complementary interests compared to an organization's business interests. On one hand, handling cyber security problems is considered to be both a nationally and internationally coordinated activity to protect national CII. Similarly, to information security goals: confidentiality, availability and integrity, in cyber security the additional goals are non-repudiation, authentication, information systems importance and criticality from the standpoint of state CII/CI. Turning to awareness, I would like to share my recent research that have been published as book, title: Interactive Cyber Security Awareness Program. It is highlighting the method, approach and the importance of current awareness level in Western Balkans. Coupled how to boost the awareness on the national level. I would not like to go in details, however, just want to mention that the positive results were presented, and that the awareness level among the end users are varied. Moreover, in particular we have to create and recognize the importance of establishing cyber security awareness strategy, coupled with influence of the weakest link in cyber security, which is the human factor, or in other words, social-technical aspects. In spite of our investment in technologies and in the applications, still the weakest link in cyber defense and security will the human behavior. Therefore, we will have to conceive an awareness/education to raise the awareness on the national behalf, such as, from the young to the oldest generation, tailored through social society, private sector and multistakeholder cooperation. Lastly, in recent years we are witnesses of acts that have taken into place between neighboring countries in the region. Such acts were followed by different motivations of attacks. Where mostly they were done through defacement's or denial-of-service attacks. Thus, motivations where divers.

In summary, I am keen that after this discussion/panel will lead into further actions. And also thanks to the organizers for the invitation and done a good job in organizing such an important event.

Firstly Obama administration get order intended to bolster cybersecurity, where the move comes after the White House tried, and indeed failed to get tough cybersecurity legislation through Congresses last year. Secondly, EU released the cybersecurity plan to protect open Internet and online freedom and opportunity – Cyber Security strategy and Proposal for a Directive. Frankly, where are the countries of South Eastern Europe (SEE) in here, such as the ones that are not in EU, for instance: Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Albania and Kosovo? Therefore, my plan, as a founder of Cybersecurity.mk would like to make a proposal of creating and teaming a group which will meet once a month to talk over another the importance of such as beneficial and in fact essential cybersecurity issues, as well as to exchange knowledge. Sharing is caring. Additionally, in every meeting we will merge and invite important people either over the remote or in the place speakers to give, share and offer us a knowledge what we should do in a near future. How we could fix and raise not only the awareness, but also the importance of cybersecurity in South Eastern Europe (Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania and Greece). For this proposal to be success we would need a help from NGO's, NPO's and any other institutes from the region and elsewhere. In addition I would like to ask hackers, crackers, ethical and non-ethical, designers, freelancers and many other to help us with the following problems: Name of the group. I will be more than happy if you could give as proposals on the comment section for the name of the group. Let us contribute together in this matter and we will be all God Fathers for the group which will help us in improving and boosting awareness level in cyber and IT security in our region. Logo. We would like to hear from any of you to design the logo of South Eastern Europe – Cyber Security Group. Please feel free to give us a link of the design in the comment section (below) and then we will select together the best proposal. Sponsorship for the speakers to invite them to meet with us in face to face, either is NGO, NPO, financial, telecommunication, insurance institutes. Proposal of speakers, list for the next meetings and place, indeed. If you have any further great ideas or proposals please do not hesitate to share them with us. We would be more than happy to take them in consideration. Nevertheless, I really hope that forming the group, such as Google Developer Group etc. will help on one hand. And on the other hand, will aid to meet one another, to discuss and share our knowledge. To learn from the best people and scholars in cybersecurity. Overall, more frequently in SEE region we have seen targets to attackers on the Internet. How do we handle this matter of facts and how we deal against? How we protect our online space? And indeed why we should take actions? Those are just a start-up questions that everyone of us should be able to answer them. Therefore, we hope that you all will contributes in the above problem that we face and will HELP us in creating this group in SEE region.","tags":"misc","title":"Cyber Security Group in South Eastern Europe"},{"url":"http://predragtasevski.com/posts/2012/12/network-security-toolkit/","text":"Introduction A toolkit is a collection of tools, where for our motives is an assembly of tools to eavesdropper and scan network security for the possible exploitations. Moreover, these tools are designed from security researchers and experts, for the purpose of network administrator and security analysts to be able in everyday work to conduct potential exploitations, to watch and to analyse the network. Additionally, network monitoring is a term to describe the system that is constantly monitoring computer network for being slow or failing peripherals, and it notifies the network administrator either via email, SMS or alarms in case of interruption of service. Equally to network monitoring, the security analysts are responsible for designing and monitoring security systems. As well as, to coordinating policies of security measures to protect information in computer files from unauthorized or accidental change, distribution or disclosure. It is therefore in this article we will introduce the readers with the basic concept and essential part of network security toolkits. As well as, already possible network security tools to help them to conduct network security monitoring and analysing. Lastly, we will give the readers with recommendation and conclusion. Network Security Toolkit In this section we will take a look at a few essential components of the toolkits, and their main goals and purposes. When we assemble the toolkit, you might want to consider having at least one of the following components included: Packet Sniffer . It is an either software or hardware piece that can intercept and log traffic passing over the network or part over the network. As the data flaws across the network, the sniffer is capturing each packets and if needed it will decode the packets raw, by displaying the values of various fields in the packet, and it will analyse the content according the RFC or other specifications. This is especially useful when dealing with security threats that produce abnormal packets or enormous traffic. As well as, it will help to diagnose failed network hardware. Port Scanner . It is software developed to probe server or host for open ports. This kind of tools are essentially in every day work for administrators to verify security policies of their network and to find unwanted running services, before the attackers. They are very useful in fact to figure and detect unauthorized systems and services. The technique that most of the tools that are using are based upon finger print matching technology. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) . It is a device or application that monitors network or systems activities for malicious hustle or policy violations and, of course produces reports to a management staff. Moreover, typically they record information related to observed events, let know the security administrators of observed events, and respond to the detected threats by attempting to prevent it from fulfil. *Log Analysers . Are dealing with large volume of computer generated log messages, known as event logs, audit records, etc. Furthermore, it deals as well as log analysis which can be in a real-time and in bulk after storage, also log search and last procedure reporting. In mace cases most of the system administrators groan of examining through log files for precious of information. Vulnerability Scanners . It is an application designed to assess computers, application, computer systems and networks for their weaknesses. There different types of vulnerability scanners by distinguished from one another by a focusing to particular targets. The functionality varies among the different types of vulnerability scanners. They share common purpose of enumerating the vulnerabilities present in one or more targets. Also they enable you to seek out if your network or system has known vulnerabilities for patching. Web Scanners . It is a program which communicates with web applications through the web front-end to be able to show potential security vulnerabilities in the web application and their architectural weaknesses. Unlike the source code scanners, web application scanners they don't have access to the source code, and that is why they detect vulnerability by performing real attacks to the web application. Password Crackers**. It is a process of either recovering or gaining access, password from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer or network. The approach is to repeatedly trying to guess the password. As well as, they allow you to quickly scan a host computer for accounts with weak password, one or the other by disabling them or force their owners to carry out and create stronger passwords. Note that the above list is just an understandable part that you should have in mind to consider had them into your everyday network security toolkit box. In the next paragraph we will give the readers with the available tools that are essential for the network security toolkits. Available Network Security Tool Most of the tools listed below are open source solutions and they cover one or more components from the above list. Additionally, for further detail information please refer to the following link http://sectools.org/ . For instance for password cracking you might use the John the Ripper and RainbowCrack tools. Where for packet sniffing there is a big variety of tools, but most commonly known are: Wireshark , Ntop , Tcpdump and many others. Moreover, to be able to conduct vulnerability scanning consider the following tools, such as, Nessus , OpenVAS , Nipper , etc. In addition to the scanners, for web application the most known is a Burp Suite , then Websecurify , Nikto and few more. For port scan you might want to consider Nmap . And finally for log analyser to come in handy is Swatch , as well as for Intrusion Detection System handy tool is Snort . Conclusion The above list of tools and the list of components will help and aim to the reader for what to have and to look at. Same as there are few of the many pieces of software put together from the dedicated security experts to advance the state of art of network security toolkit, such as, Network Security Toolkit (NST) bootable CD/DVD, BackTrack and many others.","tags":"misc","title":"Network Security Toolkit"},{"url":"http://predragtasevski.com/posts/2012/12/icsap-interactive-cyber-security-awareness-program/","text":"Abstract Currently, humans coupled with the socio-technical aspect can be either the strongest or the weakest link in any information security system, and the key in security lies in delivering awareness training through short and effective online videos, whereby the participator can gain knowledge on security. Our aim, therefore, is to develop innovative solutions to deliver an interactive cyber security awareness program, where the main goal is to enhance information on security awareness and knowledge in organizations, schools, nations, homes etc. The syllabus consists of a systematic approach divided into three sections. The introduction is a basic level course (BASIC), with the aim of delivering an elementary curriculum in physical security, computer and mobile; network and Internet security to everyone. It is made up of several units with interactive training videos that last less than 10 minutes each. The second course (ADVANCE) is the advanced program which demonstrates the attacking phases, different attacking methods and the countermeasures that highlight the anatomy of Advance Persistence Threats (APT). This curriculum is intended for administrators, help desk personnel, information technology professionals among others. The last course (MANAGEMENT) is intended for managers, where we annotate two decision-making processes with their cycle loop. Moreover, after each unit there is a questionnaire, which measures the knowledge of each participant, and compares it to the base-line survey carried out during the registration process. As a result, it represents the participant's awareness level and knowledge, and will assist in further actions if necessary. By implementing this program in private and public organizations, governments, schools and universities will lead to the improvement of security in the everyday use of computers, mobile phones, online banking, social networking_ both at home and in the workplace. The present study addresses and implements the IT security issue. We will apply the results by carrying out the syllabus, with the latest improvements, in universities and private organizations. Consequently by applying these further improvements to the syllabus, it will meet the needs of the cyber security field.

Adopt for both_ private or public needs, which are used in everyday tasks to conduct transactions and communications among individuals, business, government agencies, etc. The network consists of nodes, which are individual user computers (client terminals), and one or more servers and/or host computers. Which are linked by communication systems, some of might be private, for example company, and other which might be open to public access. Obvious example of a network system that is open to public access is the Internet, where indeed, many private networks utilize publicly accessible communications, as well. Nowadays for instance, company host computers can be accessed by their employees whether in their offices over a private communications network, or from their homes, or while there on the road. It is therefore, network security involves all activities that individuals, organizations, enterprises and institutions are undertaking to protect their value and on-going employment of assets and the integrity and continuity of operations. For that reason this article will introduce the readers and end users with the history of network security. Furthermore, with an introduction of effective network security strategy requires and most common network attacks methods. Please bear in mind that in fact, this article is not going to discuss over the depth details, rather than is going to deliver you introductory knowledge and suggestions for further perusal. And finally, we will finalize the article within conclusion. History Securing information over a network had its roots in the late 1960s when networks only existed in the sense of huge mainframes and multiple networked terminals. Hundreds of thousands and millions of dumb terminals were connected via hubs and concentrators to the huge central processing units, spinning tapes, and rotating drives in some distant air-conditioned, properly humidifier windowless room [2]. Without the presence of client-server network models, sharing or multi-user, multi-tasking processors, network security was not yet a real concern. Network security, however, has evolved over the years due to the increasing reliance on public networks not to disclose personal, financial, and other restricted information [3]. Such as, there are numerous instances Kevin Mitnick [4] and Vladimir Levin [5] cases that prompted organizations across all industries to re-think the way they handle information, including its transmission and disclosure. The popularity of the Internet was one of the most important developments that prompted an intensified effort in data security [3]. A growing number of people are using their personal computers to gain access to the resources that the Internet has to offer. From electronic email, commerce transactions and research interests, the Internet has taken place as one of the most important development of 20th century. However, the Internet Protocol (IP) in early stage was not designed to be secure. There were no approved securities standards build into the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and IP communication stack, which allowing it open to potentially malicious users and processes across the network. Where modern developments have made Internet communication more secure, yet there are still incidents that gain eminent attention and alert us to the fact that nothing is completely safe and secure. Where in early 2000 a different type of attacks were unleashed on several of the most heavily trafficked site on the Internet, such as, yahoo.com, cnn.com, amazon.com and many others. Furthermore, in 2007, a data breach exploiting the widely known weaknesses of the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) wireless encryption protocol resulted [6]. Indefinitely all those incidents have granted billion of records and money to end up in the behalf of the thief. Therefore, these results enforce the reality that computer and network security has become a quantifiable and justifiable expense for IT budgets. Organizations that require data integrity and high availability elicit the skills of system administrators, developers, and engineers to ensure 24×7 reliability of their systems, services, and information. Falling victim to malicious users, processes, or coordinated attacks is a direct threat to the success of the organization, as well as individual [3]. Network Security System and network technology is in fact a key technology for a wide variety of applications. Security is crucial factor to networks and applications. Although, network security is a critical requirement in emerging networks, there is a significant lack of security methods that can be easily implemented [7]. There is an existing communication gap between the developers of security technology and developers of networks. When considering network security, it must be emphasized that the while network is secured. Moreover, network security does not only concern the security in the computers at each end of communication sequence. Also when transmitting data the communication channel should not be vulnerable to attack. A hacker could target the communication channel, and could obtain the data, and decrypt it and re-insert a false value. In fact, securing the network is just as important as securing the computers. As a result when developing a secure network, the following need to be considered [8]: Access – authorized users are provided the means to communicate to and from a particular network Confidentiality – Information in the network remains private Authentication – Ensure the users of the network are who they say they are Integrity – Ensure the message has not been modified in transit Non‐repudiation – Ensure the user does not refute that he used the network Moreover, an effective network security plan is developed with the understanding of security issues, potential attackers and attacking methods, needed level of security, and factors that make a network vulnerable to attack. The different attacking methods are followed throughout this article endeavour. Common Network Attacks Methods Whiteout implemented security measures and controls in place, your network and data might be subjected to an attack. Some attacks for instance could be passive, meaning that information is monitored; other could be active, meaning the information is varying within intent to destroy or corrupt the data or the network itself. Likelihood your networks and data are vulnerable to any of the following types of attacks if you do not have a security plan in place [9]: Eavesdropping – Interception of communications by an unauthorized party Data Modification – Data altering, reading from unauthorized party Identity Spoofing (IP Address Spoofing) – IP address to be falsely assumed— identity spoofing and the attacker can modify, reroute, or delete your data Password-Based Attacks – By gaining your access rights to a computer and network resources are determined by who you are, that is, your user name and your password Denial-of-Service Attack – Prevents normal use of your computer or network by valid users, and it could be used for sending invalid data to application, to flood the computer, block traffic, etc. Man-in-the-Middle Attack – Is when someone between you and the person with whom you are communicating is actively monitoring, capturing, and controlling your communication transparently Application-Layer Attack – It targets application servers by deliberately causing a fault in a server's operating system or applications and the attacker gaining the ability to bypass normal access controls Anyhow, this is just a most commonly known network attacks methods, and indeed there plenty of more. Conclusion That is why network security is an important field that is increasingly gaining attention as the Internet usage increases. The security threats and Internet protocols were analysed to determine the necessary security technology. However, the current development in network security is not very impressive and significant. Therefore, researchers and scholars are rapidly evolving in developing and investigating the threats further in a future. And with this information in mind, the process can be formalized and the path becomes clearer as you delve deeper into the specifics of the security process, as well.

CONCLUSION I would like to generalize that from the above information we see that each online analysing tool has own means, criteria and different information to distribute. On the whole, some of them were not that easy and simple to use, yet they provide as with expectant information and disinfected solutions. Therefore, our succeeder for this test is ThreatExpert. But bear in mind that I have not measure and compare all the online tool-kits for analysing the files, just the ones listed in the previous section. For furthermore, please refer to the following article that was publish in 2010 by Lenny Zeltser [MalwareAnalysisToolkit]. In summary, we found out that the chosen files are malware. Likewise, can harm our computer in different methods. Yet we got an information for some, for instance how to disinfected the computer. Therefore, we made a comparison table to scale the best online analysing tool for malware. Where total number is 6 tools, and different score rank. The first one is TheratExpert, secondly is Virustotal.com and the third is Netscty. Still all of mentioned tools score difference with one point.

ANALYSIS To be able to open and use the above file, firstly we have to download the wireshark tool. Where the main goal and purpose for wireshark application is to analysis a network protocols from captured file. Therefore please refer to the following link: http://www.wireshark.org/ . Useful links for future use, please refer to [3, 4, 5 and 6]. On figure 1 it shows the Graphic Interface of Wireshark application with running filter: http protocol. Illustration 1: Wireshark application, filter: http protocol However, from the figure 1 we can see that there is a lot of traffic generated by the user. Therefore we have to apply and additional filter rules, which will help and guide for better and easy analysis. As we go through each generated http protocol traffic we can conclude that the user generated and has been visiting different source, where can be potential threat for the organization and personal use with a different malicious code. To be able to filter only the http protocols on port 80 with a header GET, we should use the following filter: http.request.method == \"GET\". Where this filter will narrow down the results that are presented into the captured file. In spite of the filter above it helps a lot, yet there is still a lot of traffic generated, consequently we have to utilize an additional filter. Another extremely useful wireshark option we used, was Analyze → Follow TCP Stream which shows communication between IP addresses in more readable and useful way: shows DNS name for the IP and if file was downloaded gives filetype and name. We discovered that IP address 79.137.237.34 belongs to accord-component.ru. When we accessed the site with various web browsers, all of them showed that it contained malware.

Figure 2 demonstrated the usage of the Find function, accessible from menu Edit -> Find. Illustration 2: Wireshark, Find function Other IP addresses that were generated/extracted first the ones with malware detected: 79.137.237.34 -accord-component.ru; 86.63.168.101 zumlelao.com . Other IP's are: 173.194.32.32 (33,34,41,50,51,52,58,59,60,63), 192.168.123.1, 193.184.164.159 (174,176,185), 193.40.252.83, 193.88.71.156, 194.126.108.69 (70), 194.126.124.136, 194.204.14.49, 195.222.15.74, 199.7.48.190, 209.85.173.95, 123.168.24.204 (209,221,225,229,235), 79.137.237.34, 80.252.91.41 (61), 69.171.228.11, 23.32.89.55, 23.32.99.172, 216.34.181.45 (48), 213.168.24.26, 90.190.148.34 (40), 86.63.168.101, 82.98.58.48, 81.19.238.61. If we run or analysis the above domain names into the google we will automatic indicated that the zumlelao.com it is an before reported as a malware site and the second too. Therefore the analysis and the infection of details of malware are highlighted into the next section. INFECTION Indeed, the above captured file presents traffic generated by the user, that can be threat for the organization, home user, etc. As from the previous section demonstrates how to identify if the generated traffic has infected or has the user visit the malicious code sites. This section identifies the malicious code and displays their details. Moreover, the zumlelao.com host it is reported previous as malicious code site. For this purpose we gather the help from the following link: http://sopport.clean-mx.de/ . Here is the reported malicious, suspicious code from the above host in the table bellow. URL Virus name IP Initial Link http://zumlelao.com/oad.php?file=grabbers 0/40(0.0%) unknown\\_htm 86.63.168.101 http://zumlelao.com/2.exe 13/40 (32.5%) TR/TDss.77.1 86.63.168.101 http://zumlelao.com/load.php?file=0 20/40 (50%) TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen3 86.63.168.101 Furthermore, figure 3 is proving the analysis made through the wireshark, were one of the above links has been access, for more details clink on the above link and points in a figure 3:A and B. Illustration 3: Prove of generating traffic of following malware link: http://zumlelao.com/load.php?file=0 were B and A are proving the links and the IP initiation. Moreover, to get the file itself for analysis, we used Netresec's Network Miner 2.1 http://www.netresec.com/?page=NetworkMiner. In Files menu, it shows all packets as files.We uploaded 4.exe.octet-stream to virustotal.com – 30 Antivirus software identified as malware Virustotal link: http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=d6ee8736cd2eae8571b193b28b59dff33e9607237f78b0888d69c70f241bb04b-1323098398 MD5 : 94a7f6430510fe7314c1e746bad79bf4SHA1 : 69ab04c9c586a8cf07a00665e160a48260a2465eSHA256: d6ee8736cd2eae8571b193b28b59dff33e9607237f78b0888d69c70f241bb04bF-Secure identified malware as Trojan.Generic.KD.438472 Trojan.Generic.KD malwares usually are classified as Backdoors. It infects executable files in the system and its main goal is to make backdoor into the system. It changes registry. In some cases it can put payload on the infected system, slow it down and make internet browsing difficult and time consuming. Aim of the malware can be stealing information or gaining partial/full access of the victim's system. On the other hand, Trojan.Generic.KD malwares are difficult to remove from infected computers. From VirusTotal analysis we can see that various antivirus software can discover and identify Trojan.Generic.KD.438472. Therefore one can remove malware by downloading antivirus software provided by F-Secure, Comodo, Microsoft, Sophos, Symantec, DrWeb, etc. Here is an example from Dr.Web how to delete Trojan.Generic.KD malware http://www.drwebhk.com/en/virus_removal/694829/Trojan.Generic.KD.53986.html For our case we downloaded Dr.Web CureIt (free edition for home PCs, which discovered the malware and removed it) – http://www.freedrweb.com/download+cureit/?nc=t&lng=en . Before continuing to disinfect the system, please read and understand the massage delivered through this forum: http://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=35407 . SUMMARY Nowadays malicious codes, infection of the system is one of the highest vector of production work everyday of the organizations. Therefore, different approaches, advance analysis, troubleshooting, etc. has to be applicable and stated in every organization. Leaking of data, information, access of network (internal and external) can be very harmful for organization and even the home usage of computers. Therefore, this laboratory report main aim is to provide the reader to be able to conduct advance analysis of system and their identification of infection within the wireshark network analysis tool. From the above sections in Analysis and in the Infection we have to follow the steps and links that will help us for a further work. Meanwhile, the captured generated traffic from the distributed file has indeed indicated that the system it is infected. Were as an prove we demonstrate an screen-shot, figure 3, that one of the infected link has been visited. Likewise, the system of this user is infected. Thus infection identified name is: TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen3, where we do supply and the disinfecting stepwise solution with the above link. Closing, as there are many different ways, tools, process for analysing the malicious code behaviours in system this laboratory report is supplying the reader with advance and stepwise solution for identifying the infection of the system within advance network analysis wireshark application. WORKLOAD We made analysis on the virtual Windows 7 machine. For virtualization we used VirtualBox. During analysis each of group member did the same analysis to cross - reference the results.

And it was known as the first wireless communication across the ocean. However, in this time likewise the computers were not widespread, the inventors and developers of wireless have not had in mind that this technology will be so spread and to carry out a security into the wireless telecommunications. Whereabouts, nowadays computers are worldwide spread in every home, in every office, and especially when we are on the road or when we travel. We used them in fact as our main devices to be able to complete and conduct our everyday tasks throughout wireless technology. Such as, to share picture, media, use different instant chatting application, video and voice calls – skype, etc. Additionally, wireless technologies have been very popular recently, in home and business users. Due to the fact that it is costs-effective, useful, no mess cables into the build or house, it is easy to set up, and it provides a great mobility. Owing to the expansibility, mobility and usability, the wireless technology and telecommunication could be at great risk. Therefore, in this article we will introduce the readers within the different categories coverage range wireless networks. Then we will go over the wireless standards, as well as the most commonly known security threats. Last but not least, we will introduce the readers with the basic wireless security measures. And finally we will summarise the article with the conclusion. Wireless Network Wireless network it is used to transport data between devices and among devices. They are often categorized into three groups based on the coverage range, such as: Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN), WLANs, and Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN). Where WWAN it involves wide coverage area of technologies, such as, Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), 2G cellular, and many other. In the other hand, WLAN unlike the traditional wired network does not need cables, it connects computers and other parts to the network using an access point device, and it has coverage areas of up to 300 feet. In contrast the WLAN, the WPAN is representing the wireless personal area network technologies such as Bluetooth and Infra-Red. Please note that these technologies receive and send information using electromagnetic waves. Wireless Standards Wireless technologies comply with a variety of standards and offer different levels of security features. The advantages of standards are to encourage mass production, as well as to allow products from different vendors to interoperate. For this article we have limited the discussion to the most commonly known IEEE 802.11 and the Bluetooth standard. Moreover, the two standards are described below: IEEE 802.11 standard. Are first developed in 1997. It is designed to support medium range, higher data rate for applications, for instance, Ethernet networks and to mobile address and portable stations. In addition, WLAN standards are designed for 1 Mbps to 2 Mbps wireless transmissions. Hence advanced support it was followed in 1999 by 802.11a, then by 802.11b standard, where the later on the security vulnerabilities of the standard have been exposed. Another standard still in draft has been developed – 802.11g, yet the massive WLAN productions now are based on the 802.11b standard. Bluetooth standard. It is an ad-hoc network standard. Are designed owing to interconnect different types of devices between each other's, such as computers, mobile phones, PDAs, etc. Their applications include wireless synchronization, e-mail, internet access using personal computer connections, hands free headsets and car kits, and many others. Wireless Security Threats As the effect of that the wireless networks are widely spread and they are available around us it represents the potential treats in wireless network. Also the security threats could be made from errors and to personal privacy. However, the most commonly known concerns in wireless security are devices theft, vulnerabilities, denial of service attacks, malicious code and hackers, services theft and foreign and industrial espionage. Moreover, authorized and unauthorized access of the wireless device may commit fraud and theft. As well as, malicious hackers may break into a network without authorizations, by exploiting the vulnerability, by brute forcing the password or other security vulnerability flow to do hard or to gain personal information or needs. In addition, malicious hackers or crackers are usually people from outside of an organization or agency. Conversely, users within organization and agency are a threat as well. Furthermore, they could gain access to the wireless access point by eavesdropping on wireless device communication. Additionally, malicious code includes such as, worms, Trojan horses, viruses, or other unwanted code, application that are designed for purpose to damage files or bring down the system or the entire network. Service theft is when for instance an unauthorized user gains access to the network and in worst case customer data or network resources. And last, foreign and industrial espionage covers gathering data from corporation or intelligence information from government. Especially in wireless network espionage is very simple because the transmission of data is across radio waves. Wireless Security Measures From the previous paragraph we can conclude that actually wireless network it has different approaches and methods of threats. Therefore, in this section we will concentrate of how to apply security measures in our wireless network, either are for a personal or organizational usage. First step is to create a Security Policy. It defines what it means to be secure, as well as includes restrictions on wireless LAN functions, traffic, flow, and access. Second is to configure for Secured Network Access, by implementing and configuring setup password protection, also to physically secure the WLAN and to secure the WLAN. It can be secured from intruders by wireless authentication, such as: WEP (Wired Equivalency Privacy) – which can be hacked very easily); WPA and WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access) – are more secure alternatives, where unlike the WEP and WPA, WPA uses the AES (Advance Encryption Standard) and it supports two modes of authentication – WPA2-PSK (Pre-shared key) and WPA2-Enterprise (EAP/RADIUS) mode. Thirdly by controlling wireless visibility by Service Set Identifier (SSID), this is visible and real name of the wireless network. Last but not least, by securing the network with virtual segmentation, called Virtual LAN. Finally, we recommend on-going security maintenance and continue education. Conclusion Today wireless networks are helping and definitely providing the opportunity to the organizations, individuals and business to cut costs, to increase the productivity and mobility. By following the above recommended security measures the everyday work will in fact continue without any interference. The key to keep up and creating a security wireless network is on-going running business and organization.","tags":"misc","title":"What is wireless network security?"},{"url":"http://predragtasevski.com/posts/2012/06/ministry-of-interior-macedonia-website-defacement-httpmvrgovmk/","text":"Purpose Yesterday, the 25 of June 2012, the Macedonian website of Ministry of Interior (MVR) was defaced by Kosovo Network Security (KNS) group, below figure. However, after we have noticed and some of the social networking sites have informed me, I was concern to find out what just have happened and how did happen, and of course how they have done it. So for this purpose, I have done some digging into details, about the previous defacement activities of this very important government site. But before we continue with more details, let just talk about the situation of yesterday and what did the authorities take protective measures steps and actions. On Monday, 25 June 2012 at 19:38, one friend have updated his status in one of the social networking sites, as follows: \"Хакован http://mvr.gov.mk/ \" (Hacked http://mvr.gov.mk/ ). And it made me extremely intrigue to see what actually have just happened. The below figure, displays the message spread from the KNS group. Screenshot from the mvr.gov.mk defaced version Moreover, what makes the situation even more interesting is that after the report that the site was defaced the authorities have taken a measures steps to fix the issue, by either shutting down the server or restoring the content of the site from the backup. Then after one or two minutes the site was defaced again. I did not want to lose the time and the nervous to check every five or ten minutes to see when it will be back again. Nevertheless, after 15 hours, or one stressful – hard core night for the administrators of the site, the usability and functionalities where back as normal, let just see how long will stay! Therefore, in the current post the idea is to give and overview, of what actually is going on when it comes to case of cyber space, cyber security issues in Macedonia. The structure of this post is introduces first with the issue, or the problem that actuality made me to write this post. Followed by the background investigation about the previous defacement activities on the Ministry of Interior website in Macedonia. Then with the background investigation about the KNS group, moreover, with the self pen-testing site with different attacking methodologies. And finally, closing by with a conclusion and action plan that should be taken, for hence actions. This post does not only involves the public sector, but even and the private sector too. Those agencies, organizations are too much careless and do not take any actions of securing their IT assets. Introduction Ministry of Interior in Macedonia site offers different online services. The site primary idea is to inform the inhabitance about the news, actions, useful information, public relations, analysis and statistics; international cooperation and legislation; and finally the services. And secondly is to give and opportunities to the population scheduling of service, if their document is issued, etc. In one short sentence, this site, for some people, it may be very useful or not. However, I need to empathize that the site is only available in Macedonian language, nor Albania, nor English version. So, in simple conclusion this site is only useful for Macedonian speakers, and not for foreigners, yet still represents one of very important public service, government agency. Nevertheless, in the next section we will discuses the previous defacement and hacking attacks of this site. Background The service of this site, or the domain first was registered in 22 October 2003, and unfortunate I do not remember when was first time available and published. However, in the pass years I have heard many times that this site was defaced and hacked, but still no actions or results were shown. Therefore, it made me very interesting to find out, if this defacement activities where notified and when and how many where. For this purpose I have use a site service that I know few years ago, the Zone-H . Moreover, Zone-H is neither responsible for the reported computer crimes nor it is directly or indirectly involved with them, it is just and simple site where collects the cybercrime activities notified anonymously. The bellow figure provides a details of previous reported/notified cybercrime activities of MVR site in Macedonia. In details, total notifications are 4 of which 2 are single IP and 2 are mass defacements. The first mass defacement was done in 29 July 2009, when the site use a OS: Windows 2000, then in 2011 it was the re-defacement and the server operating system is Windows 2008. Followed by the other massive defacement in this year 2012 in March 18, and same year, few days before the current attack, 22 of June it was re-defacement. And the attack, defacement that we write for it was not notified or reported. From these data, and schedule, we can come to a conclusion that the site was defaced just 3 days before the mass defacement attack, so it might be a simple warning, to taken an action before something goes really wrong. But most probably, non of those administrators, or authorities did not taken any serious actions, until the case yesterday appears. Details To be able to do an analysis of what actually have happened, we need to take some actions. First, we have done a simple web sniffer, to find out what kind of system, and services the site, server is using. If we request the HTTP Request Header we will receive an HTTP Response Header with a following data: Status: HTTP/1.1 200 OKCache-Control: privateContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.0Set-Cookie: ASP.NET_SessionId=3lti3gep3usg4255ggf34tjn; path=/; HttpOnlyX-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727X-Powered-By: ASP.NETDate: Tue, 26 Jun 2012 08:18:34 GMTConnection: closeContent-Length: 103773 The above data, is useful in a sense that provides as an information about the Server and the ASP.Net Version. Then, if we want to find more details about the open and close ports and operating system we can use the nmap tool with the following command line: nmap -O -v IP-Address And the results will be as follows: PORT STATE SERVICE21/tcp open ftp80/tcp open httpRunning (JUST GUESSING) : Microsoft Windows Vista|2008|7 (89%) From the web sniffing and from the OS version scanning we can assume that the server is running Microsoft Windows 2008. The current vulnerabilities and possible exploitations are visible on the Microsoft Security Bulletins website. By knowing the vulnerabilities it is very easy task to find out a way either to commit DoS attack or remote server access. However, in this post we will not go into details and exploitation descriptions. Moreover, the KNS, we assume the domain is followed: http://kns-team.com . However, the site is down, therefore, we will have to understand who is behind this domain registration. Therefore, we will use the whois database to understand more, or even we can use another site that have been defaced by this group to find out more. So there is the list presented the members in the groups and their archive of notified defaced sites: rAcKeR-BeSi GP L0wHacker sLizer X-r00t SpyHackz The Facebook fan page is: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kosova-Network-Security/176195849098989 . For more info I was short of time to do more digging, but I hope that someone will. Action After understanding the details about the MVR site, operating system and their server services, and information about the KNS, it is time to take an action of trying to see how vulnerable is MVR site, and to see if these lads had very difficult time of defacing the content of the site, or even gaining access to the server-side. But before, we carry on, I want to stress out that this section is not to give you an idea how, or knowledge to exploit or use any vulnerabilities to deface or gain access to the site. We will just demonstrate you a very simple XSS exploit of MVR site that we have found a vulnerability, figure below. Example of exploitation by XSS vulnerability, mvr.gov.mk It is therefore, from this very simple and easy exploitation of XSS vulnerability of the MVS site we will be able to run more advance and complicated shell scripts to gain access and maintain access of the server. Our initial idea is not to show you how to do it, but to expose to the audience that actually hence actions is need it. And we hope that the administrators, developers and the authorities will take an action of mitigating the risk, and further vulnerabilities of the site. Conclusion In Macedonia, cyber space, cyber crime, cyber security, cyber warefare, cyber terrorism are actually unknown words, terminology. They are not even specified or added into the Macedonian dictionary, nor in IT dictionary. However, this is not the first or least defacement, attack that has happened in Macedonia, nor the first attack that has been done, implemented by neighbor countries, or someone else. I just don't understand why people in this country are so careless about how to protect their IT assets, and everything else, as well. Furthermore, it is not an issue that we do not have specialists to conduct a pen-testing to the sites and services that not only the government agencies are offering but even the banks and private sectors as well. We even have a cyber crime unit in Ministry of Interior, and one of very successful information security research and development laboratory in Macedonia: Zero Science Lab . Also, the ICSAP – Interactive Cyber Security Awareness Program , Macedonia project, developed by myself. Nevertheless, in final conclusion, I would like to recommend the authorities to take actions about the above described activities done by KNS and hope that the security awareness will boost up, and the further actions will be considered of securing cyber space.","tags":"misc","title":"Ministry of Interior – Macedonia, website defacement: http://mvr.gov.mk"},{"url":"http://predragtasevski.com/posts/2012/06/texworks-05r952-error-libpoppler-qt4so3-ubuntu-1204/","text":"I had to use the texworks to do some changes in my LaTeX CV template, and in the previous version of Ubuntu I had not issues at all.

It is therefore, I will provide the readers and solution of how to fix this issue. But before we continue I would like to mention that this issue has never been posted before, anywhere else. Installation of Texworks In the shell command we install the texworks with the following script: sudo apt-get install texworks Issue / Error After the installation is finished, then if we try to run the program from Unity or even from the terminal, it will give us an error:\\< texworks: error while loading shared libraries: libpoppler-qt4.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory```So now we know that there is some issue with the ```libpoppler-qt4``` library. To determine if we miss any other dependency libraries we can double check with the following command:```ldd /usr/bin/texworks```And the following output should look like this: linux-gate.so.1 = (0xb76f2000) libhunspell-1.3.so.0 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libhunspell-1.3.so.0 (0xb7682000) libpoppler-qt4.so.3 => not found libz.so.1 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libz.so.1 (0xb766b000) libQtDBus.so.4 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtDBus.so.4 (0xb75eb000) libQtScript.so.4 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtScript.so.4 (0xb7367000) libQtScriptTools.so.4 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtScriptTools.so.4 (0xb72b2000) libQtXml.so.4 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtXml.so.4 (0xb7272000) libQtGui.so.4 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtGui.so.4 (0xb679e000) libQtCore.so.4 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtCore.so.4 (0xb64c1000) libpthread.so.0 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0xb64a6000) libstdc++.so.6 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 (0xb63c1000) libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 (0xb63a3000) libc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xb61fd000) libdbus-1.so.3 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libdbus-1.so.3 (0xb61b4000) libm.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 (0xb6188000) libfontconfig.so.1 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libfontconfig.so.1 (0xb6154000) libaudio.so.2 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libaudio.so.2 (0xb613b000) libglib-2.0.so.0 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libglib-2.0.so.0 (0xb6041000) libpng12.so.0 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpng12.so.0 (0xb6017000) libfreetype.so.6 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libfreetype.so.6 (0xb5f7d000) libgobject-2.0.so.0 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libgobject-2.0.so.0 (0xb5f2e000) libSM.so.6 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libSM.so.6 (0xb5f25000) libICE.so.6 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libICE.so.6 (0xb5f0a000) libXi.so.6 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libXi.so.6 (0xb5efa000) libXrender.so.1 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libXrender.so.1 (0xb5ef0000) libXext.so.6 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libXext.so.6 (0xb5ede000) libX11.so.6 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libX11.so.6 (0xb5daa000) libdl.so.2 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0xb5da4000) librt.so.1 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 (0xb5d9b000) /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb76f3000) libexpat.so.1 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libexpat.so.1 (0xb5d71000) libXt.so.6 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libXt.so.6 (0xb5d15000) libXau.so.6 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libXau.so.6 (0xb5d11000) libpcre.so.3 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpcre.so.3 (0xb5cd4000) libffi.so.6 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libffi.so.6 (0xb5ccd000) libuuid.so.1 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libuuid.so.1 (0xb5cc7000) libxcb.so.1 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libxcb.so.1 (0xb5ca6000) libXdmcp.so.6 => /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libXdmcp.so.6 (0xb5c9e000) Where we can see from the above output that the ```libpoppler-qt4.so.3 = not found ``` is missing.The best way to solve this issue, first we have to locate where are the other libraries of QT4. This is very simple approach, because the other libraries links, location is provided from the above output. Therefore, we can see that in the path ```/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/``` there is an library called: ```libpoppler-qt4.so.4```.# ResolutionFrom the above output, and the path that we have found of the missing library, there is an simple and easy way of fixing this issue, shown below.Therefore, in the terminal we can make an soft link with the missing library from the already existing one, with the following:```sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpoppler-qt4.so.4 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpoppler-qt4.so.3```And now the texworks works perfectly!# Details \\$ texworks --version TeXworks 0.5r952 (Debian) Copyright (C) 2007-2011 Jonathan Kew, Stefan Löffler License GPLv2+: GNU GPL (version 2 or later) http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.

Nevertheless, the event was performed from 30 of November until 3rd of December by non-governmental, non-profit youth voluntary organization, The Centre for Intercultural Dialogue (CID) . In the request to the organization I was invited to deliver training-speech as an expert in the cyber security to the above topic. To get an idea of what was the content of training I have provided you with the slides below, as well as the pictures taken during training. Unfortunately, the presentation slides are only in Macedonian language. If anyone needs the content on the slides in English please fell free to contact me. Moreover, I would like to thank the organizers for the invitation, as well as, for a great organized event and kindly words from the trainees. The group to the panel discussion was very enthusiasts, knowledgeable and experience to share and to give an interesting ideas for the hence actions. The conclusion from the discussion was made. As well as, that this is just a step to bring the topic into Macedonia, and for the organizations and groups to become more familiar and aware about the Hate Speech on Internet as extremely important topic to be taken into consideration.

Moreover, DDoS [1] attacks, malicious code, etc. Therefore, we need to develop countermeasures for the working attacks simulated with a standard DoS attack from a single IP address (performed with AB [2] or Jmeter). Limitations for this scenarios is highlighted: No additional hardware can be used The wordpress installation can not be optimized: no caching plugins, no reverse-proxy (varnish, squid etc) No reactive measures that automatically block incoming traffic: the site must respond to at least some of the requests coming from the attacker at all times The countermeasures must not have negative effects on \"normal usage pattern\". Normal usage pattern is defined as: Bursts of 10 connections per IP address in 1 second Page load times not over 10 seconds - Normal usage must be possible from the same IP address that the attack originated from after a 20 second delay maximum. In addition, we have to make much of the rules for the scenario. Rules as follow: Fresh installation of the latest version of Ubuntu Server and the most recent WordPress as of 20.10.2011. First priority: No normal usage pattern connections can be dropped! Second priority: service speed of normal connections. Defined by number of connections / second (easy to measure). Third priority: How fast after the attack is stopped, the site can be accessed from the attacking IP again. Each test and measured results will be exposed in to Test section. Whereas, the process of installation of clever solution and attacking scripts will be provided in to Appendixes section. Finally, the measurement results will be compared with the first state without attack and any security solutions applied. Alternatively, providing measurement results with one solution and attack will help us to identify the most beneficial security solution. Therefore, in Conclusion section comparison results will be highlighted. TESTS Because of requirements of our scenario we need to display the results before security solution is applied and attacker performance. For this purpose we are going to use an AB script to display the response time of the server: ab -t 10 -n 10 -c 10 http://192.168.56.102/wordpress/ The above script provides detail information, yet only important is Request per second. Thus, with an fresh installation and without any security solution, it provided with result of 3.95 [#/sec]. With other word, 3.95 number of request per second. After applying different security solution and performing an attack to the server, results will be divers. In addition, test were done by two different virtual environment machines. One is for testing results and the other one is to perform attack with the following script: ab -n 100 -c 10 http://192.168.56.102/wordpress/ TEST 1 First test is to install libapache2-mod-evasive [libapache2-mod-evasive]. Where, mod_evasive is an evasive maneuvers module for Apache is to provide some protection in the event of an HTTP DoS or DDoS attack or brute force attack. It is also designed to be a detection tool, and can be easily configured to talk to ipchains, firewalls, routers, and etcetera. The process of installation and configuration refer to the Appendix 1. After completed the installation and configuration process it is time to test the security solution and to highlight the results. Before performing the attack the results were somehow, lower then, before installing the mod-evasive, 2.06 number request per second. When we start the attack and in same time analysis the server responded with timeout. The conclusion is that mod-evasive it is not enough solution. TEST 2 From previous test we can see that the solution was not enough clever for our needs. The server somehow was dead. However, we are going to install now mod_security module for apache, with side of previous test. For more detail information of installation process and configuration refer to Appendix 2 or to the following source [mod_security]. CONCLUSION There are three points that we should consider and to see which proposal was more accurate and it did the job that was required in the scenario. In conclusion, the above proposals are nice and good example to have an view of how and with what tools we should perform script kiddie techniques. How to shutdown access to a server. On the whole, it show as how to use tools and methods of measuring the bandwidth of network and how to limit the transfer in comfortable way. APPENDIXES Appendix 1 is connected with the Method 1, which highlighted points are illustration on what information we should check, to clarify that the virtual environment has limitation of the network interface. Where Appendix 2 is for installation process of Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS and wordpress, mysql installation.

In addition, we have to develop/download/find/whatever a SNORT configuration (rulesets, preprocessors, whatever) that performs better than the default configuration in previous post. By better we mean: Less false positives Less false negatives The objectives are contradictory so the rule of thumb is one false negative per 10 false positives eg. solution with 10 false positives and 2 false negatives is better than the solution with 100 false positives and 1 false negatives, but the solution with 10 false positives and 1 false negative is better than the solution with 1 false positive and 2 false negatives. Attack is defined by a single invocation of all the test scripts in a row. Meanwhile, the new rules have to be able to detect not only the default attacks that are set to a default snort configuration, yet they have to be able to detect SQL injection, brute force password, apache killer script, pytbull, etc. Furthermore, in figure 1 we are illustrating the scenario. Illustration 1: Illustration of Scenario Therefore, in the proposal section we will present two proposals that have been submitted due to this laboratory test and additionally in result section we will highlighted the identification numbers made by snort set new rules. In section appendixes we will provide you with more details configuration procedures, configuration of VM's – Virtual Machines, attacks, etc. Finally, closing with an conclusion and the results of best set of rules made of the proposals. SETUP of SNORT To setup snort in a right way, that will work for the second Host only network please following the instruction link provided with a full description and configuration of snort [SNORT2]. PROPOSALS In total two proposals are presented in next sub-sections. PROPOSAL 1 Add http://www.tud.ttu.ee/~t061780/attacks/robert.rules to your Snort. On your Snort machine: cd /etc/snort/ruleswget http://www.tud.ttu.ee/~t061780/attacks/robert.rules Now you have the rules, add them to your snort conf file (default /etc/snort/snort.conf). To do that inser: include $RULE_PATH/robert.rules somewhere with rest of the rules after line 800. Run Snort and test. PROPOSAL 2 Add the following rules: http://predragtasevski.com/src/predrag.rules . To be able to insert the snort rules in to the snort file please double check where it is located. You can find the location with the following command: find / -name snort.conf Before you continue please change the IP address to your server address on line number #6, example alert tcp any any -> 192.168.56.X where x is your octet. Then to add the following rules at the conf file do the following command: cat predrag.rules &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; snort.conf Now it is time to start or restart snort. It should work. RESULTS After executing the above proposal we will highlight the results into the table bellow. Result are presented from the total amount of reports, registered alerts in the snort. This is done by help of web interface of Basic Analysis and Security Engine in addition Analysis Console for Intrusion Databases (ACID) project tool [ACID]. Therefore, the result from the proposals are highlighted below: Attack performed Proposal number Baseline Total number of Alerts Total number of Alerts Unique Alerts SQL injection 1 0 0 0 SQL injection 2 0 52 1 Pytbull – evasion 1 N/A 128 6 SQL injection + nmap Combine both N/A 36 5 Pytbull Combine both N/A 844 7 Table 1: Details of total report numbers of alerts made by SNORT and the different proposal rule sets. Details of the attacks conducted in the table are presented in appendixes section. Additionally, figure 2 is presenting the pine chart of the total number alerts recognized by Snort. Illustration 2: Total number of Alerts. Secondly, figure 3 is representing the pine chart of total number of unique alerts recognized by Snort. Illustration 3: Total number of Unique Alerts CONCLUSION From the above results we came to conclusion that the new applied rules were successful and were able to recognize alerts more then the default rule set of Snort. Meanwhile, only proposal 2 was able to recognized an SQL injections without any additional tweaking. Although proposal 1 was still useful, on the other hand the best solution is when we combine the both rule sets proposals. Then the Snort is able to recognized an significant number of total alerts and additionally for our laboratory report more interesting is unique total number alerts. Closing, even the default Snort rules configuration is good, yet when you tweak it by your own needs, you will have much better IDS system for your network. In future it should be recommended always refer to [snort_rules], to gather more available advance Snort rules, made by experts. Where will help you to configure and setup Snort IDS system to detecting attacks against a wordpress site, etc. APPENDIXES Appendix 1 is the configuration of the attacker virtual machine, in more detail Blacktrack 5 distribution.

Virtual machines presented by the lecture: Win 1 Win 2 The assignment is following: Find out what is infecting the machine win1 Understand which way is the current malware dangerous to \"your organisation\" If possible, do clean win1 Is win2 clean or it has problems, too? If needed, do clean win2 Additionally, deliverable questions should be visible: Summary – Your thoughts about the exercise. Please provide a short Malware that infects machines Md5 hash – if it possible and if not, please explain, why. Sha256 has -if it possible and if not, then please explain, why. A description – in which way that malware is a threat to \"You organization\" Tools You used to find the infection(s) Tools You used to clean machine(s) Where You found hints and how exactly You did it (you need to show Your thought and communication process – please write a summary of it.) How would you evaluate your partner. Moreover, we have to consider the malware analysis report reminders, please refer to [1] or [2]. Furthermore, each virtual machine will be analysed with different tools, in case to gather more information and solution for disinfecting process. Structure of the laboratory report is first to present each virtual machine with details information in section Virtual Machine's, Each visualization is examined. Malware and disinfection process are described. Meanwhile in appendices, we explain what virtual environment and tools we have used for this written report. Finally the conclusion made of all analysis will be concise in summary section. VIRTUAL MACHINE's In this section each virtual machines are going to be examine in sub-sections, analysis and additionally the disinfection solutions, etc. will be presented. The tools that are used for conducting the analysis are presented in the Tools section. Win1 Intense detail information are highlighted bellow and MD5 sum for Win1 virtual box machine: OS: Ms Windows 7 ProfessionalVersion: 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601System type: 32 bitComputer name: DoeMUsers Names:- Jane Doe- Jhon DoeMD5 Sum: 6313cf7303de37ba62aadf5208b6ea78 Analysis The analysis starts firstly from the observations, then with an supporting figures, sample of identification, are there any dependencies and in closer with summary of the analysis. From analysis with a different tools we came to conclusion that the above virtual image it is infected with some malicious code. Were certain tools have provides as an information that there is background accessing to network. However, this analysis it is not enough so therefore we will do more inside investigation to come-out with the hosts or network that the malicious code is trying to access, or an information that is shared. To be able to identify the behaviour of a network we have used the Wireshark tool. Bellow are highlighted the steps: Network adapter type: NAT, logged in as: John Doe, additionally Wireshark run as Administrator. Upon the testing, the only user application open on WIN1 is Notepad. No additional network activities from log-in user, also no network activities from user on Host System. Wireshark, it detected suspicious traffic: Classification: BAD TCP (according to Wireshark coloring rules), Destination: 192.168.0.254 / 8.8.4.4 (Googne Public DNS) with Protocol: DNS; Info: Standard query A mamtumbochka766.ru / Standard query A followmego12.ru / Standart query A losokorot7621.ru / standard query A hidemyfass87111.ru /; Reason for classification as BAD TCP: Header checksum incorrect, maybe caused by \"IP checksum offload\", Message: Bad Cheksum, Severity level: Error As a response, WIN1 machine got UDP packet (according to Wireshark coloring rules); Protocol: DNS; Info: Standard query response, Sever failure. Additionally, Wireshark detected another round of BAD TCP packets; Classification: BAD TCP; Destination: 195.226.218.135; Protocol: TCP; Port: 50530; Info: HTTP ACK (before that, WIN1 sent ACK message, got SYN ACK and this packet was an ACK). Where during HTTP session, WIN1 machine received the following linebased text data: i5eOnJKV57mp5biuqK+0tri0tbW+uK+0qeDr57mp5b29uL6pr7ypurm5vqng6+e5qeU= ; Then WIN1 received FIN ACK message from server and send ACK and FIN ACK. Session was finished. The session was repeated once in 3 minutes and received line-based text data, for all sessions was the same.

In spite of comprehensive information and some suspicious activities, these tools were unable to show direct link to malware. We analyzed some suspicious DLLs and .exe files, but all of them appeared to be legitimate Windows files. Also ee turned to Security Task Manager by Neuber Software where it discovered file 061afffa0005f9e5.exe in C:\\Users\\JHONDO~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp folder. Usually malware runs itself or is hidden in Temp folder. So weird name and location give us enough reason to think it's malware. Additional information provided by Security Task Manager: Company: Not provided; Type: Program. Hidden; Starts: when Windows starts and Registry: win.ini. Meanwhile, for advance analysis we have conduct with clean boot which is explained into the KB article in the following link: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135 . Now we run the wireshark analysis network tool, where no more suspicious network traffic is identified. This means that the malicious code is running from 3rd party applications and not from Microsoft services or process. Likelihood, to be able to identify the malicious code, threads in virtual machine, we recommend to run an online free virus scanning. Thus process is done by ESET free online tool scanning, refer to the following link: http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/ . The aim of this step is to help to identify if the threads have been registered in to the virus signature database. If so, this will be a useful information and will assist to continue with analysis.

Additionally to the analysing packets with Wireshark showed that Win1 has some malware, which sent and received some information over network without knowledge of the user. Destination IP addresses, names and port numbers were suspicious. Disinfection Indeed, this virtual machine it is infected. Therefore we have to perform an disinfection process. However, from the above table of the links it provides an solution and steps that should be followed for disinfection process. Either with an tool or steps for removing the malicious code. Also, we can remove the files with some additional tools that are available for free, for instance Eraser tool. Now that we know the exact location of each infected file it is much easier and simple to be able to delete, remove the files from our system. Although we could use the Eset scanner tool that we have performed previously. Nevertheless, to be sure and more save way is to do the removing process manually. Therefore, recommendation for deleting the malicious code of all time from virtual machine is eraser tool. You need to configure task and which folders or files you specify to be removed. After the task was completed, restart the machine and now the system should be disinfected and additional we recommend to run the Eset online scanner free tool one more time, just in case in a meaner of your organization. Win2 Intense detail information are highlighted bellow and MD5 sum for Win2 virtual box machine: OS: Ms Windows 7 ProfessionalVersion: 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601System type: 32 bitComputer name: DoeMUsers Names:- Jane Doe- Jhon DoeMD5 Sum: 155a5b9e8b842dff4aa5a7b4361113d3 Analysis Despite the fact that Process Monitor, TCPView and other Sysinternals Suite analysis tools did not help us at all (also Wireshark did not detect any suspicious network activities), at this point, additionally registry changes were detected with CaptureBat tool, where the log file will be presented in figure 2. However by running the ESET online free scanner tool, it did detect in total three threads to our virtual machine, logs are presented bellow. Eset Online Scanner, found 3 threads: C:\\$Recycle.Bin\\S-1-5-21-1301155936-2652204530-896827088-1001\\$RKV8ZW1.exe Win32/Duqu.A trojanC:\\Users\\Jane\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\0004fbd1.tmpa variant of Win32/Kryptik.VFI trojanC:\\Users\\Jane\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\b01dffe3001c4fe2.exe Win32/TrojanDownloader.Agent.QXN trojan Threads are located in to the system directory of Jane user name. Additionally, there is an other malicious code located into the Recycle bin as we were able to detect into the previous analysis for Win1 virtual machine. In spite of fact that in previously scenario we had only a threads located into Recycle Bin, at this virtual environment we have as an local files. Therefore to be able to identify the above file and there integrity we have to sum the MD5 and SHA256 algorithms. For this action we are using an online tool winMd5Sum. File name MD5Sum SHA256 C:\\\\Users\\\\Jane\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\0004fbd1.tmp aa17de9a17a58840b8f3b3bd5412daee 6d242dbfec946dcacc90d624defb073cb7d7bcc531c06d566933610fef62f986 C:\\\\Users\\\\Jane\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\b01dffe3001c4fe2.exe dc88442c440a5fa5c5fa449a2d0ab1e5 d9a874bf8d9f2f2ca803d38abd677ab51e77008b6cfbab37525dd28df71be107 For advance analysis, we will run the MD5Sum into the virustotal.com search to identify the threads. Indeed, all of the above have been reported previously as a malware. Meanwhile, to gather better description of the above malicious codes we will search the definitions in the Eset database and descriptions provided in the following table.

Therefore, we need to run either an registry system check or as we know the location of the malicious code, with OllyDbg we can run the files and inspect there behaviour and if they have any additionally affect over the memory dump, etc. presented in figure 3. Illustration 3: OllyDbg analysis, memory dump, system dll access, etc. Nevertheless, because now we have the locations and the threads description it is next step to disinfected the system, yet it is still a big thread for the organization, etc. Disinfection As on the previously scenario, we recommend either to use the Eset online free scanner or to use in more convinced way the Eraser tool, for removing the malicious code from the machine forever. Furthermore, to just make sure that the above malicious code is removed, disinfected from our system still recommendations is to run the Eset tool for a second time, for double check the system. All the above files and threads could be a very harmful for the organization and for everyday production work. Therefore, advance analysis of the system it is always in hands to help us to protect our data, internet access, etc. of being leaked. Tools Tools that help for conducting the results are highlighted in this section. Those are just few of them that are available for this purpose. Nevertheless, we have use only the listed ones. Tools and downloadable links: CaptureBAT: http://www.honeynet.org/node/315 - Most of the tools that are used for this laboratory report are Sysinternals Suite: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb842062 - Advance report: HijaskThis: http://free.antivirus.com/hijackthis/ - Wireshark: http://www.wireshark.org/ - ESET Free Online Scanner: http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/ - Eraser: http://www.heidi.ie/eraser/ - Virustotal: http://www.virustotal.com/ - Security Task Manager: http://neuber.com/taskmanager/index.html - OllyDbg v1.10: http://www.ollydbg.de/ - WinMD5Sum: http://www.nullriver.com/products/winmd5sum However, there are many other tools that can be used. Recent papers, tutorials can help us for further action, please refer to [3] [4] [5] [6]. SUMMARY Nowadays malicious codes, infection of the system is one of the highest vector of production work everyday of the organizations. Therefore, different approaches, advance analysis, troubleshooting, etc. has to be applicable and stated in every organization. Leaking of data, information, access of network (internal and external) can be very harmful for organization and even the home usage of computers. Therefore, this laboratory report main aim is to provide the reader to be able to conduct advance analysis of system and their disinfection. From the two scenarios, virtual machine environments we came to final consistent conclusion that both of them are infected. Yet different threads were able to be found in the systems. However analysis is done by the short time of period. In each scenario in report provides an solutions how and what kind of actions should be considered for future disinfection of the system. Moreover, in next lines we are stating the summary of each infected machine. Firstly, Win1 was infected with identified 20 threads, with other words in total of 9 different definitions of trojan, malware, warms code. The definition of the threads were advance, where from the links provided in the table above, is stated that the few of them were playing very smart. By smart, we mean, that if they have noticed that wireshark, tcpviewer or other tools were running, the malicious code stops responding, so it was able to cover his identity, information leaks, etc. In addition, the malicious codes were located in to the Recycle bin folder, where we were not able to identify there MD5 sum or SHA256. If we want it to proceed in this step, we had to restore them from the bin folder and then identify them. Advance we identify the user that has spread the malicious code, user name: John Doe. Nevertheless, disinfecting process helped us to remove the code from the system and just in case we have run in second time the Eset online scanner tool. Secondly, Win2 was indeed infected too. In spite of the scenario one, this was less infected. The total sum of the threads were 3. Each of them were supply by the administrator user account: Jane Doe. The location of the malicious code is located into the temp folders and one in a recycle bin directory. From the definitions links from the above table we can stated that they have try to attempt over the network to leak informations, registry changes and additional files are added to the system. However, all of them were harmful for our environment and therefore and disinfection steps were necessary. Additionally, the location of the files were accessible therefore we provide an addition MD5sum and SHA256 for each file, were it help us to identify them in virustotal.com . Finally, the both virtual box were infected with different malicious code. Advance disinfection procedures were necessary to troubleshoot and find the solution to make the hence system for being able to use it in production. However, the threads were able to share, leak information and data, in advance were able to change the registry and even the system files. Therefore, we do recommend advance furthermore actions to be considered. Meanwhile, the list of the tools that is provided by this report will help the hence users and analysers to be able to identify the threads in a system and to perform an disinfection. Additional the tutorials, stepwise solutions were provided as a reference where can guide for more advance troubleshooting. Closing, as there are many different ways, tools, process for analysing the malicious code behaviours in system this laboratory report is supplying the reader with advance and stepwise solution for identifying the infection of the system. The above procedure can be applied into real time, everyday working machine. WORKLOAD We analysed both Win1 and Win2 on our computers. Virtualization environment for both host systems were the same. Each of us analyzed Win1 and Win2. First we analyzed Win1 and then Win2. So the group analyzed each of Virtual Machines (Win1 and Win2) two times. In such way we cross-referenced the analysis results and got more reliable information about the system and its infection. APPENDIXES Appendix 1 is configuration of the virtual environment.

The post is introducing four following topics: Session storage's in Ruby on Rail Parameterized statements into Java with JDBC, C# with ASP.NET, PHP5, php-mysqli, Perl, Python and Hibernate Query Language (HQL) Unix permission model, Unix ACL and Windows 7 security model Finding all the security vulnerabilities in bash script Each topic will be divided into own section, where at the end of each topic we stated the reference and additional reading material. The source code, scrips and the additional task were given by the lecture. However this will help the readers and people interesting into programing for further work and involvement with the above topics. 1. Session storage's in Ruby on Rail Session in Rails is a hash-like structure which allows you to store data across requests. Sessions can hold any kind of data object (with some limitations) because they store data using Data Marshalling.Session in rails it is not a hash. Session creates new instant of session in every time new user visit the site. Recommendation is to not store large objects in a session and critical data should not be stored in session.Rails way of implementing session is: session_id is a 32 hex character MD5 hash based upon time, random number and constant string. It is stored in cookie at client browser. Rails provides transparent support for session_id. Session storage discussed below. Ruby on Rails provides with many session storage option: PStore – it implements a file based persistence mechanism based on a Hash. User code can store hierarchies of Ruby objects (values) into the data store file by name (keys). An object hierarchy may be just a single object. User code may later read values back from the data store or even update data, as needed. The files that are stored are usually located in the tmp/sessions folder for the Rails app. The main downside of using the PStore is that you will have to do some session-pruning periodically because performance decreases as the number of sessions stored increases. ActiveRecordStore – keeps the session id and hash in a database table and saves and retrieves the hash on every request. CookieStore – it saves the session hash directly in a cookie on the client-side. The server retrieves the session hash from the cookie and eliminates the need for a session id. Cookie-based sessions are just faster to retrieve and process than hitting the file-system on every request, were it was previously. Cookies are generally limited to 4K in size. While not an issue for most (proper) usage of the session, this could be a legitimate limit for some scenarios. If your application abuses the session, you'll need to decide on a different session store that are available. The cookie has a SHA512 fingerprint attached and is hashed with a secret stored up on the server and there are, however, derivatives of CookieStore which encrypt the session hash, so the client cannot see it. DRbStore – it store uses distributed Ruby to store a user's session data. The performance is great, but it requires a bit more setup than the other stores. FileStore – This store keeps the fragments on the hard disk instead of in memory. It works well if you have a lot of file storage and have outgrown the MemoryStore. MemoryStore – keeps your session data in server memory. It keeps the fragments in your application's memory, which can potentially take up a lot of memory on your server. It is used by default, but it is hard to manage and scale if your application becomes popular. Note: Ruby on Rail CookieStore is available only in edge rails. PStore is the default option for stable release, whereas its CookieStore as default for edge rails.

Parameterized statements into Java with JDBC, C# with ASP.NET, PHP5, php-mysqli, Perl, Python and Hibernate Query Language (HQL) For this task we will take a look at the parameterized statement API-s and we will find out and document how much does each of them protect against the following possible misuses of SQL statements: String injection (quotes, double quotes) SQL statement injection (expression syntax etc) Out of range integers Blind SQL injection Java with JDBC PreparedStatement prep =conn.prepareStatement(\"SELECT * FROMUSERSWHERE USERNAME=? AND PASSWORD=?\");prep.setString(1, username);prep.setString(2, password);prep.executeQuery(); There are no possibilities of string injection because of the filtering the statements. It enables users' input to be initially filtered instead of directly embedding it in the SQL statements. In this example is that the each parameter is a scalar, not a table, where the user input is then assigned (bound) to a parameter. It is a good idea if the character range is limited. Another thing that can be done to avoid SQL injection is to convert numeric values to integers before parsing them into the SQL statement. Or using ISNUMERIC to verify that they are integers. C# with ASP.NET using (SqlCommand myCommand =new SqlCommand(\"SELECT * FROM USERSWHEREUSERNAME=@user ANDPASSWORD=HASHBYTES('SHA1', @pwd)\",myConnection)){myCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@user\",user);myCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@pwd\",pass);myConnection.Open();SqlDataReader myReader =myCommand.ExecuteReader();...} The placeholder – @user and the hashbyte value of password @pws – has become part if the hardcoded SQL. At runtime, the value provided by the querystring is passed to the database along with the hardcoded SQL, and the database will check the Username and password field as it attempts to bind the parameter value to it. This ensures a level of strong typing. If the parameter value is not the right type for the database field (a string, or numeric that's out of range for the field type), the database will be unable to convert it to the right type and will reject it. If the target field datatype is a string (char, nvarchar etc), the parameter value will be \"stringified\" automatically, which includes escaping single quotes. It will not form part of the SQL statement to be executed. PHP5 $db = new PDO('pgsql:dbname=database');$stmt = $db-prepare(\"SELECT priv FROM testUsers WHERE username=:username AND password=:password\");$stmt-bindParam(':username', $user);$stmt-bindParam(':password', $pass);$stmt-execute(); In this example to protect against SQL injection, it is used an input not directly to be embedded in SQL statements. Instead, it is used an parameterized statements (preferred), or user input must be carefully escaped or filtered. This example shows and parameterized example/statement in php v. 5 and PDO database to protect from SQL injections and blind SQL injections. PHP-MySQLi $db = new mysqli(\"host\", \"user\", \"pass\",\"database\");$stmt = $db - prepare(\"SELECT priv FROM testUsers WHERE username=? AND password=?\");$stmt - bind_param(\"ss\", $user, $pass);$stmt - execute(); Same as above but this time it is used the vendor-specific methods; for instance, using the mysqli extension for MySQL 4.1 and create parameterized statements to protect from the SQL injection. Perl use DBI;my $db = DBI-connect('DBI:mysql:mydatabase:host', 'login', 'password');$statment = $db-&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;prepare(\"UPDATE players SET name = ?, score = ?, active = ? WHERE jerseyNum = ?\");$rows_affected = $statment-&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;execute(\"Smith, Steve\", 42, 'true', 99); Automatically \"sanitize\" input to parameterized SQL statements to avoid the catastrophic database attacks. Python import sqlite3db = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')db.execute('update players set name=:name, score=:score,active=:active where jerseyNum=:num', {'num': 100, 'name': 'John Doe', 'active': False, 'score': -1}) It is parameterized statement with an example of named placeholders. Which insure to avoid the SQL injections and database attacks. Hibernate Query Language (HQL) Query safeHQLQuery = session.createQuery(\"from Inventory where productID=:productid\");safeHQLQuery.setParameter(\"productid\", userSuppliedParameter); Unsafe example: Query unsafeHQLQuery = session.createQuery(\"from Inventory where productID='\"+userSuppliedParameter+\"‘\"); The example from left it's used prepared statement approach because all the SQL code stays within the application. This makes your application relatively database independent. However, other options allow you to store all the SQL code in the database itself, which has both security and non-security advantages and the approach is called Stored Procedure 3. Unix permission model, Unix ACL and Windows 7 security model In this topic we will describe two security set-ups that can not be expressed with traditional Unix permission model, UNIX ACL and Windows 7 security model. Unix permission model Giving an different permission to different users in the same group Read and write permission/access to all groups, which gives and access to the ‘private files', and you can gain access through a root account by an unwanted user, which brings and complete breach of the system Unix ACL- enabled permission model If the user has permission over the file, he can read/write and delete it, which brings that it is not possible to give ‘some' permission to the user. ACL's are not very portable and are very hard to maintain. For instance good example is transferring of files with ACL's between different of Unix systems is an exercise for brave person, even if the both file systems support them. Which brings a difficulty to maintain for existing files for instance backup, restore, copying, etc. Windows 7 security model As a standard user you can perform an action that requires administrator privileges by the UAC(User Access Control), which is controlled by the Admin Approval Mode. It can be turn off and on. Every time when you need to gain an access of the administration privileges it will be prompt a dialog box to gain and provide the password for an access. Therefore in the medium settings with any malware could turn it off. And the settings of the UAC are in medium mode not off, still brings an opportunity to being turn off by the malware. 4. Finding all the security vulnerabilities in bash script In this topic we will find all the possible vulnerabilities into the following bash script: +--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+ | | | | | | | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516 | #!/bin/sh# remove files with nam | | 17181920212223 | e pattern matching regexpif [ x \\(1 = | | | x ]; then# if [[ x\\) 1 = x ]]echo -n \" | | | Please enter directory name: \"read d | | | irelsedir= \\(1fiif [ x\\) 2 = x ]; then# | | | if [[ x$2 = x ]]echo -n \"Please ente | | | r pattern: \"read patternelsepattern= | | | $2fifind $dir &amp;amp;amp;amp;g | | | t; /tmp/listing# can use &amp;am | | | p;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt | | | ; or print the output first beforecm | | | d='rm grep '$pattern' /tmp/listing | | | ' #+the command is executeecho \"Runn | | | ing command $cmd\"eval $cmd //it conv | | | erts string in commandrm /tmp/listin | | | gexit 0 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | +--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+ We should avoid temporary file, instead we should use pipes [2]. We should avoid eval [2]. Using the double brackets, instead of single one [[... ]] it is comment on the script above [1]. \\$REPLY can be used to read the previous value of the dir and pattern variable [1]. We can use instead of find, while read contracture (loop) [1]. Find – can be set with a cycle, for or while to check the validation of the file and the directory/path, also comment on the script or using \"$pattern\" /tmp/listing [1]. No sensitization of the input, the user can put any value and therefore, execute any command to create another command. As we can see above the script it looks like that it is security vulnerable. If we want to implement the security in the script we should implement the above changes into the script. Reference [1] Mendel Cooper, 30 April 2011.

Thus access of the document will inform us immediately with the information of the burglar. The report should highlight the following aspects: Constructed an document as non malicious code, for instance honey document that will help us to track from where, who, information about the system, etc. is using our document. Detail description of process, how did we build the document and the idea behind the tracking system. Description of needed infrastructure that is tracking the document. The laboratory report is created by a team of 7 members. Where each member had own task to accomplish. Moreover, to be more contingent the unknown person has gain access to our computer/laptop. Thereby he is looking for interesting name of file, folder, etc. that most likely will have a content of interesting data, information for his purpose. After he downloaded file/folder from our system the intruder will open this file in his system assuming that contains very important personal/corporate information. However, by opening this file/folder, document it will send us immediately leaked information about his system to our server and additionally an e-mail. This process and procedures that are behind the honeypot document, or with other words trap set to detect, deflect, or in some manner counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems [1] is described in following sections. Furthermore, the coding of the honeypot document is done in HTML file with additional java script queries, where detail information and construction are displayed in Honeypot section. Meanwhile in Appendix section we provide the code of the honeypot document and additional what is the leaked/collected information of the intruder system, with other word, content illustration of mail and server logs. Finally the conclusion made of the laboratory report will be concise in summary section. HONEYPOT IDEA HTML file We can name the file online banking or etc. cause it is html and it is more convincing way that the attacker will assume that this is an not only a online banking link but yet an the stored cookies and other leaked information. The honeypot file has inline javascript that will collect as much information as it can from the users browser, make it into a JSON object and create a request to our server using that information. The request will return an image, so nothing will be broken, however on our server we decode the information and send ourselves an alert email, that someone has accessed that document and where the accessing came from. There is also an image embedded that requests it from our server- these requests are logged and we see the IP address of the opener. This is as a backup in case the user doesn't allow javascript to execute. How we lure an attacker into trap To discover the identity of attacker and get information, she/he has to open html file. Besides setting up honeypot from technical point of view, we have to make document attractive. On our system all the documents will be protected by (different) passwords. We can have same password for files with same extensions (for example, for PDFs or for MS Word documents). In html file, we store these passwords. The name of html document should be corresponding (\"file passwords\" for example). Attacker will need additional time to crack the passwords, so we are offering easy, quick way to get over additional obstacles. Actually, in html file passwords should be correct not no make the attacker suspicious. Attacker may be suspicious why we stored this kind of information in html file, but it can be explained with the following reasons: a) to open html (with notepad or browser for example) is quicker than opening .pdf and .doc (by Adobe Reader and MS Word respectively) b) html has different extension (.html) that PDF or MS Word documents, so it has different icon in GUI. If you put a lot of different files in a folder, html is much easier to find with a glance among PDFs and DOCs. What information we get The honeypot is scripted to give us the following information about the attacker: first of all IP address. Time, hen the attacker accessed the honeypot file. Except that, we also get information about user agent, OS, language and other details about attacker's system. For this concrete task that should be enough. The script is configurable to get some additional information too. As our plan is to simply gather information on our infiltrator, it is essential to avoid being malicious with our code. It will not alter target's system or bypass any restrictions of it. The solution will not announce itself and will be as stealthy as possible. The information is sent to mail. For the example of sent e-mail, please refer to Appendix 2. HONEYPOT INFRASTRUCTURE We need a Web server running PHP. The PHP script will collect the JSON data received from the attacker, format it nicely and send via email to people who will process it. If JavaScript is not enabled on the attacker's side we rely on the fact that a picture is accessed from the honeypot html file. The server has to serve this image and the request for it of course appears in the web server access logs. This information again is processed by the same PHP script mentioned above and forwarded to analysts. Another alternative way to inform security personnel about this honeypot image being accessed is the Simple Event Corelator (SEC) written by Risto Vaarandi [2]. This software is freely available under GPL license. We could write a rule for SEC that would monitor the web server access log file for the specific image file request and send an email with the IP address from which the image was accessed. The rule that is used for SEC can be found in Appendix 3. The content we are looking for in the log file may look like this: ```192.168.1.34 - - [07/Dec/2011:19:16:07 +0200] \"GET /honey.png HTTP/1.1\" 200 1932``` # SUMMARY Nowadays the most common vector in unauthorized access into the system is followed by stealing important data, either is from personal computer or corporate network. Therefore, solution of implementing a trap for detecting, and deflecting the attacker of collecting valuable information is important. This laboratory report consists solution for future detection, by creating an honeypot document that will help us to collect data from the attacker. The document it self it is not an malicious code, likewise does not corrupt or infect the attacker system. Solution provided above is designed with an simple infrastructure which help us to identify identity of attacker in different operation system. Moreover, the honeypot document provides us an information of what is the attacker or user of this document operation system, which browser he is using, what plugins are installed in the browser and additional the time of accessing the file and attached IP address. Thereby, by identifying the above information will guide us in further steps. For instance by identifying his IP address we can find his location, ISP, etc. However, is this above provided information enough? The answer to the question is simple, indeed it is, cause we don't need more. The idea in this laboratory is not to find or assail the attacker, but it is just to identify, and realize that someone had an unauthorized access to the system and to distinguish his identity. Consequently, from the above we can conclude that we rather gather the information from the attacker then to attack him back. # APPENDICES Appendix 1 is the HTML and Java script code presented and in addition in Appendix 2 we present the e-mail received after the attacker has open the document. SEC are described in Appendix 3. # Appendix 1 HTML + Java script code presented below: wzxhzdk:0 ## Appendix 2 What we receive via email: wzxhzdk:1 ## Appendix 3 SEC rule file for web server log monitoring (will work only for IPv4).

Thereby please follow the following steps for completing the task: Unpack the file (hint – using zip on .jar) Examine .class files using tool available here (local copies for Mac and Linux and Win Find code sending SMSes using ‘sms://' URI Calculate short number used in SM.send Finally for compiling the code use the developing tool Eclipse IDE . Firstly, we are going to analysis the Java source code after decompilation. The accent is to find the code that is sending an SMSes using the ‘sms://' URL. After identifying the linking associated classes we have to compile the code to move toward to final results of URLs. For this purpose we are using the developing tool Eclipse IDE . Therefore, the results and the sent SMSes URLs are going to be presented into conclusion section. Which will complete the task and will yield the basic analysis of mobile malware file. ANALYSIS After running the decompiler tool we are examining and analyzing the Java source code. Whereby on the source code on the class M.class line 343 we have found the following source code: if ((i >= 35) (SM.isSending != true) (i % 6 == 0) (f & count_query)) { if (SM.GS()) f += 1; if (f == 1) { RS.L(rs); RS.L(\"Slide\"); rs = RS.j(\"Slide\"); game = RS.L(rs, Integer.toString((int)(System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000L))); RS.L(rs); }if (f < count_query) { game = SM.send(\"sms://\" + ms[1][b], ms[2][b]); // sms:// if (b == count_query) b = 1; else b += 1;} The above code is associated with the class SM.class. With the following source code: public static int send(String s, String s1){ if (isSending) return 0; new SM(s, s1); return -1;}public SM(String s, String s1) { success = false; isSending = true; this.destination = s; this.message = s1; try { Thread thread = new Thread(this); thread.start(); } catch (Exception exception) { isSending = false;} The above code is checking if the message and the destination is correct and if the message is sent. Coloration is more like the first public static method named send with the two string values of s and s1 . All the above extraction was finished by JD-Gui version 0.3.3 and JD-Core version 0.6.0 and using the menu bar for search, with the criteria that will meet our needs.

CONCLUSION We live in a world where nowadays for everyday work, communication, etc. the most essentially tool is our mobile phones, smart phones, etc. We used them for communication, sending SMS, playing games, checking e-mails, social networking, bank transaction, etc. That is why today there are hundreds and rising everyday mobile malware files. We need to make sure what we are installing in our devices, what kind of games, applications, etc. Therefore, this post will help for a people who are interested to learn basic of how to analysis and identify malware files for mobile phones. However, this is only a basic, and a good guide to give you an idea of what kind of tools, applications you should have. This task is done only for a Java source code mobile malware game. Furthermore, from the above section we have identify the number of SMSes that are sent and to what numbers. The total number of SMSes is 4 and sent to the following URLs: sms://7375sms://7202sms://1899sms://8385 Finally, mobile malware is rising and it is about to explode, therefore users need education[1]. By delivering basic and advance mobile malware security awareness program we will have less malware attacks and better security policy into everyday mobile, smart phones usage.

In the following lines we describe the goal and the rules of the task, whereby follows with the working solution. Task Write a regular expression for matching the names which follow the following rules: Each name consists of one or more parts. If there are two or more parts, they are separated either with a single space (\" \") or dash (\"-\") character. Each name part must consist of letters only. The name part must begin with an upper-case letter which are followed by one or more lower-case letters. Each name part can have an optional prefix which begins with an upper-case letter, followed by one or more lower-case letters. Solution &#94;([A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)?(\\s|-))*[A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)?$ For completing the task, we are dividing into several sub-tasks. Firstly, we had to find expression, which satisfies the first requirement of the task: representing one or more parts, which can be separated either with space (\" \") or dash (\"-\"). Thereby, we can represent space and dash with the following expression (\\s|-). If the entry is just one legitimate part (without space or dash after), (\\s|-) has 0 occurrences. Yet the entry may consist of many legitimate parts divided by spaces or dashes. The expression should be (\\s|-)*. As for the legitimate parts, we have to write expression considering second part of requirements. Legitimate part should consist of letters only, begin with (only one) uppercase letter and followed by one or more lowercase letters. Legitimate part can have prefix beginning with (only one) uppercase letter, followed by one or more lowercase letters. Therefore, [A-Z][a-z]+ represents the entry which begins uppercase letter and is followed by one or more lower case letters. In addition, to represent prefix, which occurs either 0 or 1 time, we will have the following expression: ([A-Z][a-z]+)? . Moreover, to represent the whole legitimate entry, we merge the two expressions (it does not matter whether prefix expression comes first) with: [A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)? . Thus with this expression we go back to (\\s|-)* where putting [A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][az]+) into parentheses with (\\s|-) and take * outside of parentheses (as this whole expression) legitimate part with either space or dash should be presented for 0 or more consecutive times. (([A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)?(\\s|-))* To be able to exclude entries, which end with \"-\", we add expression of legitimate part. and add \"\\&#94;\" and \"\\$\" respectively at the beginning and the end of expression, to mark the beginning and an end of the string. &#94;(([A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)?(|s|-))*([A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)?$ Finally, we have the whole expression we have to test it (we have to put the expression in quotation marks). egrep ‘&#94;([A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)?(\\s|-))*[A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)?$' file_name The above solution is written by: Predrag Tasevski and Mikheil Basilaia","tags":"misc","title":"Regular Expression"},{"url":"http://predragtasevski.com/posts/2012/01/testing-ids/","text":"SCENARIO The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to create a solution and instructions for testing an IDS\\&#94;1 systems usefulness for detecting attacks against a wordpress site. In addition, a repeatable process to evaluate vendor claims. Whatever passive IDS system sample delivered as a VM or a dedicated box. Creating the IDS system itself is out of scope. The process must be detailed enough so that somebody else can get the same results when applying that. The \"other person\" is expected to have IT knowledge sufficient to install and run a Linux desktop. Budget requirements: Modest – 2 machines + a tester (Joe) + networking equipment to connect the two machines and an IDS together. The process must test at least the following attacks: Port scan SYN flood \"Regular\" DoS overwhelming attack (Ab) Optionally the process may test: slowloris/pyloris Apache Range header DoS vulnerability http://httpd.apache.org/security/CVE-011-3192.txt An attack targeting any other fairly recent (not older than 3-4 years) known vulnerability that could in theory apply to the target system (wordpress server) However the competition rules are: The highest number of attacks evaluated. Limits: Each attack must be relevant eg. if it attacks IIS it's NOT relevant. If it attacks Windows RPC it's not relevant. If it attacks some other CMS eg. Drupal it's NOT relevant. * Basically equivalent attacks count as one (different port scanners for example). You must be able to explain in broad terms what the attack does eg: attacks the vulnerability #X in Apache server If the #attacks is equal. Lab instaractions: Install 3 VM-s: Attacker IDS and Target ​1. Make sure all VM-s have two network adapters: NAT and Host-Only. ​2. Install Snort and it's GUI called \"acidbase\" on IDS https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SnortIDS . ​3. Install Apache, Mysql and WordPress on Target. ​4. Execute an attack on Attacker towards the IP address on the Host Only network. ​5. Take notice of the results displayed on Acid console. ​6. Reset counters, move on to next attack. Additionally, illustration 1 describes the overview of above scenario Illustration 1: Lab 5 Illustration of Scenario Firstly, setup procedure of snort, secondly available proposals and thirdly illustrating the results and the functionality of proposals. Finally, closing this laboratory report with conclusion. In addition, appendixes is configuration of VM's – Virtual Machines. SETUP of SNORT To setup snort in a right way, that will work for the second Host only network please following the instruction link provided with a full description and configuration of snort [SNORT2]. After completing the setup and configuration to run snort on the second interface use the following command: snort -c /etc/snort/snort/conf -i eth1 PROPOSALS In total three proposals and each one is highlighted in the next sub-sections. PROPOSAL 1 Full instructions ​1. Set up IDS (Snort) and WordPress on the first PC ​2. Install Ubuntu server on the second PC . Then install all attacking tools there: ```wget enos.itcollege.ee/\\~avein/lab4i.sh sudo sh lab4i.sh After that you should have:- ```ab.sh``` – DoS attack script – uses ab to generate traffic flood- ```apachekiller.pl``` – Apachekiller attack script More info: http://www.hackersgarage.com/apache-killer-denial-of-service-flaw-in-apache-webserver.html- ```README.txt``` – extra instructions- ```scan.sh``` - Port scanning script - uses nmap- ```sloworis.pl``` - Sloworis attack script More info: http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/- ```synf.sh``` - syn flood attack script - uses hping33. Start your IDS/wordpress server and the server with attack tools. 4. Run each attack tool ONE AT A TIME (targeting the wordpress/IDS server of course) . Monitor the logs/notifications on yours IDS system (SNORT) and check whether wordpress site is still accessible. Let each attack tool run 2 minutes, then stop the attack by pressing CTRL+C on the terminal window where the attack tool is running. The only exeption is port scan- its better to wait until it finishes. After each attack save the IDS log and wait atlest 5 minutes before trying next tool (to give server time to recover). Best practice is to manually check if the server load is at normal (one can use htop for that).a) To run DoS attack:```sh ab.sh {target} eg sh ab.sh 192.168.56.101```b) For port scan:```sh scan.sh {target IP} eg sh scan.sh 192.168.56.101```c) For Syn flood (with hping3)```sh synf.sh {target} eg synf.sh 192.168.56.101/wordpress```d) For Sloworis attack:```perl slowloris.pl -dns {target} eg perl sloworis.pl -dns 192.168.56.101/wordpress```e) For Apachekiller attack:```perl apachekiller.pl {target IP} eg perl apachekiller.pl 192.168.56.101```## PROPOSAL 2### IntroFor this scenario we need to run several different attacks and scans to be able to compare the results with different IDS setups and rulesets. We might also want to test it with legitimate traffic to see that we dont get false positives in our alarms. We dont have that much legitimate traffic possibilities with 1 blog on our servers right now, but if we start tweaking the IDS false positives becomes an important metric and we might want to test normal usage and create traffic to run with tcpreplay for example. My proposal is to test the IDS with pytbull running on BackTrack. Pytbull is IDS testing framework and BackTrack a Linux ditribution. I will assume that we have WordPress server with running default Snort set up on it and working. No extensive testing has been done with different snort setups so we might have to tune the methods, but basic things should be covered.### DL and install BackTrack- backtrack-linux.org/downloads/ Install it rather than running a live version for this scenario. Boot it up in default mode, start GUI and launch installation from desktop. Default login root / toor. Standard setup comes with pytbull and several pieces of software the IDS test-system depends on like nmap, hping3, nikto and others.### Setup connectionsConnect the machines and install ftp and ssh on server. We need ftp to get snort alert files and ssh to run attacks against.```apt-get install vsftpd openssh-server```### Setup pytbullYou will find pytbull from ```/pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/``` or Applications -> BackTrack -> Information Gathering -> Network Analysis -> IDS IPS Identification -> pytbull when using the GUI. Change the configuration file values to have correct connection information, user credentials and locations of dependencies. Here you also select which test modules out of the 9 available you want to run. ClientSideAttacks needs extra configuration. cd /pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/ gedit config.cfg Example conf file: http://www.tud.ttu.ee/\\~t061780/attacks/config.cfg Now get custom DoS module to have hping SYN flood and ApacheBench DoS tests covered. cd modules mv denialOfService.py denialOfService.py-backup wget http://www.tud.ttu.ee/\\~t061780/attacks/denialOfService.py You may want to refer to Pytbull documentation ### Run```/pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/pytbull -t WP/Snort server IP;```If everything works you will find html report file under /reports. If you have problems add -d on run for debugging.###(optional) SlowlorisTo have slowloris attack test for pytbull we need to get custom slowloris that allows to set how many packets to send because we dont want the tests to run forever. I added argument s that tells the script to stop after we have sent s packets. cd /pentest/stressing wget www.tud.ttu.ee/\\~t061780/attacks/slowloris.pl Slowloris attack has been written into DoS module, you have to uncomment it. Lines 47-52. gedit /pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/modules/denialOfService.py ## PROPOSAL 3For this proposal I will suggest to use open source tool OpenVas for vulnerability scanning, to test our IDS system. It contains many security tools integrated. The security and analysis tools are: Nikto, nmap, ike-scan, snmpwalk, amap, ldapsearch, SLAD (John-the-Ripper, Chkrootkit, LSOF, ClamAV, Tripwire, TIGER, logwatch, trapwatch, lm-sensors, snort and ovaldi), pnscan, portbunny, strobe, w3af, etc.Instructions of installation process, for further more information please refer to http://www.openvas.org/setup-and-start.html ### Step 1: Configure OBS Repository```sudo apt-get -y install python-software-propertiessudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:/OpenVAS:STABLE:/v4/xUbuntu_10.04/./\"sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys BED1E87979EAFD54 sudo apt-get update Step 2: Quick-Install OpenVAS sudo apt-get -y install greenbone-security-assistant gsd openvas-cli openvas-manager openvas-scanner openvas-administrator sqlite3 xsltproc Step 3: Quick-Start OpenVAS (copy and paste whole block, during first time you will be asked to set a password for user \"admin\") test -e /var/lib/openvas/CA/cacert.pem || sudo openvas-mkcert -qsudo openvas-nvt-sync test -e /var/lib/openvas/users/om || sudo openvas-mkcert-client -n om -i sudo /etc/init.d/openvas-manager stopsudo /etc/init.d/openvas-scanner stopsudo openvassdsudo openvasmd --migratesudo openvasmd --rebuildsudo killall openvassdsleep 15sudo /etc/init.d/openvas-scanner startsudo /etc/init.d/openvas-manager startsudo /etc/init.d/openvas-administrator restartsudo /etc/init.d/greenbone-security-assistant restarttest -e /var/lib/openvas/users/admin || sudo openvasad -c add_user -n admin -r Admin Step 4: Log into OpenVAS as \"admin\" Open https://localhost:9392/ or start \"gsd\" on a command line as a regular user (not as root!). Optional we can use and the Slowloris and Pyloris DoS attacks. Download link for Slowloris is: http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/slowloris.pl The above solution and tool will help us to check and test our IDS system usefulness. It tests the following attacks: Port scan, SYN flood, DoS, etc. The results are presented with nice GUI interface. For more info about the project please refer to www.openvas.org . RESULTS After executing the above proposal we will highlight the results. Nevertheless, only the Proposal 1 was able to run the test. Others two, Proposal 2 and Proposal 3 were unsuccessful of installation process and configuration and to run the attacks. Moreover, the result are presented from the total amount of reports, registered alerts in the snort. This is done by help of web interface of Basic Analysis and Security Engine in addition Analysis Console for Intrusion Databases (ACID) project tool [ACID]. Therefore, the result from the Proposal 1 and from the rest are highlighted below: Proposal 1 DoS – registered alerts: 2; Port scan : 8; synf.sh: 1344; slowloris.pl: 1782; apachekiller.pl: not working; - Proposal 2 - pytbull: 0, the message was: Error: FTP error, 550 failed to open file. - Proposal 3 - Too complicated to be configured and installed. The instructions and the procedures should be more easy. After few hours of configuring and test, tweaks are is still not working. Yet there are many good tutorials how to configure OpenVAS please refer [OpenVas1] and [OpenVas2]. CONCLUSION Primarily, setting-up IDS, the Snort, it is not an easy task to complete. On the other hand, configuring, installing, etc. the testing tools for IDS system is even more complicated. Therefore, the Proposal 1 has the best solution and installation process of the test tools. Despite, that it was the only one that worked. Finally, recommendation for the IDS solutions and in addition to the penetrating tools to test the usefulness of IDS has to be more simple and stepwise solution. However, the above scenario and proposals are great tools and solutions for a future reader.

Here is the scenario: your client is worried about some stuff posted on a blog. They ask You to take care of it. They have a throwaway \"script kiddie\"[Script kiddie] in a third world country, who will mount the attack so You don't need to worry about hiding the attackers identity. Therefore, we need to devise a way to attack wordpress (default installation) based site to render it unusable (page view times over 60 seconds). Attack resources: one PC with Microsoft Windows XP, a script kiddie, internet connection of 2Mbit/s. In addition, server has to stay down for two days and script kiddie has up to 1 day to set up the attack. For scenario above their three different proposals from the fallow students. Each proposal is described in section Proposals and their effectiveness, installation process and the evaluation of the efficient use of available resources. Firstly, easy solution for limiting the internet connection of 2Mbit/s by Oracle VirtualBox configuration manager. Secondly, the bandwidth capacity of the connection and their performance is measured by vnstat1 for graphs to display our utilization. The steps are vivid on section Methods. Finally, providing measurement results with different proposals will help us to identify the most beneficial proposal for above scenario, declared in Conclusion section. Moreover, after each attack, test the virtual server environment is restarted, because of the affective situation that server after attack needs time to recover. METHODS Because of requirements of our scenario we need to limit the internet connection of 2 Mbit/s and to provide graphs that can help as with the measurement results to conclude which proposals is more competent. Therefore, Method 1 is describing the step how we limited the connection bandwidth and Method 2 providing as solution how to setup that can help you in measuring the speed and the bandwidth. METHOD 1 For limiting the internet traffic of the server we have to do the following steps in command prompt. The following solution is gathered from Manual of Oracle Virtualbox, Chapter 8 [User Manual]. Limiting VirtualBox – virtual environment speed of network interface: VBoxManage modifyvm \"[name of virtualbox]\" --nicspeed2 2048 Where you need to replace name of virtual box with real one, and specie which network interface adapter you wont to limited. In the above illustration is only second network adapter affected and then you set the limitation, in our case is 2 Mbit/s. Furthermore, to make sure that the result have been effective please use the following command: VBoxManage showvminfo \"[name of virtualbox]\" Results and information important to be aware refer to Appendix 1. METHOD 2 We are going to install an application that will help us to gather a visual graphs of traffic manipulation of script kiddie. The application is vnstat. In the server virtual environment in command prompt please type the following command: sudo apt-get install vnstat Next step is to select which interface should be monitored and create graphs. In our case is eth1, which is second network interface. For furthermore detailed installation process please refer to the following link: http://www.4geeksfromnet.com/2009/04/graphical-bandwidth-monitor-for-ubuntu.html To check if the installation process is finished please use your browser, as shown in illustration 1 and on the address bar type: http://192.168.56.102/vnstat Illustration 1: Vnstat PHP interface PROPOSALS The three proposals are following and described in each different section and their results. The main measure goal which is going to grate for kiddie script is: easy to use instructions, the most efficient use of available resources and can the script be up to 1 day attacking. Moreover, the results will be provided with two different graphs in period of 5 minutes attack and 10 minutes attack. Which would guide us to compare which kiddie script has performed the attack more in force. PROPOSAL 1 This is the first proposal and the installation process instruction: Script kiddie uses a little program to connection flood the WordPress installation! The program uses Apache autobench to take the site down in seconds. Guide for the scipt Kiddie: Download the program from http://enos.itcollege.ee/~avein/anti2.rar Unpack and run AntiXakkerv2.0.exe Enter the address for wordpress site and press the button Above script did no run/work on the VirtualMachine Windows XP. Therefore, from the same author we have other solution: ​1. Download http://enos.itcollege.ee/\\~avein/anti.exe , save it on Desktop ​2. Open Start menu, select run and type \"cmd\" into the box and press enter ​3. Drag anti.exe file to the black box (commandline) , select the box and type the address of your server ( eg. www.delfi.ee ) after the anti.exe For example, if the address for your webserver is 192.168.56.101 type the following: anti.exe 192.168.56.101 Press enter and the site will go down very soon :=) P.S. This is lightweight version tat doesnot use much bandwith and is targeted against a bug in apache server :) RESULT 1 After running the first proposal we can see that the script kiddie does attack the server, but the server was reachable after a bit long delay, but still we could access to the wordpress. Here are some results graphs. 5 minutes attack Illustration 2: Proposal 1, 5 min, traffic graph 10 minutes attack Illustration 3: Proposal 1, 10 min, traffic graph On the one hand the script kiddie did attack the server, but on the other hand the server was still accessible. I'd like to conclude by stating that the above script did not meet our needs, and it did not stop, bring down the response time of the server. PROPOSAL 2 Second proposal and the installation process: You (Script kiddie) download the file from http://share.ee/x49176f You will get an warning message, but you continue to download anyway In chrome it looks like this Execute the file Will get a warning but continue Will look something like this Insert the URL to attack and define how long you want to attack Will look like Enjoy The script is basic vbscript that will overwhelm the server by as many connections that are required to keep the server down for as long as you define. The above script did not work on the laboratory performance, because it had an code error. Therefore, for this proposal we are not able to provide you with the result graphs PROPOSAL 3 Third proposal and the installation process is listed below: There is a free and very easy Denial of service script written in PHP, called Keep-Dead (Version 1.14). You can download it from the following link: http://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/imp/2011/03/Keep-Dead.zip It is developed for a research purpose, but still we can use it for our scenario. The good think is primarily meant for use via the terminal; although it will also work if launched via the browser. Unpack the Keep-Dead.zip Open in notepad or any other text/script editor On line #26 change the $target_url = \"http://www.example.com/wordpress/?s=%rand%\"; to our targeted wordpress blog. We can stop even certain page or post in wordpres or use of %rand% for a random value to be automatically generated for each individual request • You can change the maximum number of requests to be made on line #32 Changeable is maximum number of requests to be made per connection #37, etc. After setting the setting of our needs save the file. And in terminal you need to run the following script: php –e keep-dead.php or if you run a xamp or other webserver it is possible to run the script from your browser. You can terminate the script by pressing CTRL+C in terminal console or stop/close the browser. For more information or video tutorials please refer to the following link: http://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/keep-alive-dos-script/ If we follow the above steps we can perform our scenario 3 to make the server to stay down for two days or even more. There many ways to keep the server down for two days, this script for me is kind of easy usable. In addition, the author had provide and more details with following content: In addition of my proposal pls install the following script: http://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-5.3.8-nts-Win32-VC9-x86.msi in the installation process in the section of Select Web Server you wish to setup please chose Do not setup a web server -> Next click on the PHP small narrow down icon and select Entire future will be installed on local hard drive (second option) -> Next ->Install The results and graphs of the above proposal are demonstrated in the next section. This is the script that actually does the job and it keeps the server down until the script is down. RESULT 3 Test results are following: ​1. 5 minutes attack Illustration 4: Proposal 3, 5 min, traffic graph 10 minutes attack Illustration 5: Proposal 3, 10 min, traffic graph A case in point is that from the above graphs we can see that the server does get more traffic and it does get attacked by the script kiddie. Illustration 6, bellow demonstrated that actually the server is down, is not responding any more to requests. Illustration 6: Proposal 3, server down after trying to reach the blog CONCLUSION There are three points that we should consider and to see which proposal was more accurate and it did the job that was required in the scenario. First I would like to start with rating from 1 to 5 each proposal. Higher score present better results. Which is proving our destination to hold down the server for longer then one day. The bellow table demonstrates which proposal has succeed. Proposal 1 Proposal 2 Proposal 3 Easy installation 5 5 4 Server down 3 1 5 TOTAL 8 6 9 On the scoring rate 3 of server down is means that the server was down, but after few seconds was retrievable. Where the highest score 5 means that the server was not retrievable during this proposal test until we shutdown or cancel the process of script kiddie. In addition, the Proposal 3 due to a code error was not able to perform attack, that is why it is graded with server down score of 1. Therefore, our winner for this laboratory test is Proposal 3 with script kiddie Keep-dead. The next issue that I would like to focus is to the network speed, tested with other tool bmon2 which manifests that the speed limit of the bandwidth did not go over the 2 Mbit/s. In conclusion, the above proposals are nice and good example to have an view of how and with what tools we should perform script kiddie techniques. How to shutdown access to a server. On the whole, it show as how to use tools and methods of measuring the bandwidth of network and how to limit the transfer in comfortable way. APPENDIXES Appendix 1 is connected with the Method 1, which highlighted points are illustration on what information we should check, to clarify that the virtual environment has limitation of the network interface. Where Appendix 2 is for installation process of Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS and wordpress, mysql installation.

There are few points that should be presented: Where did we discovered the information (links or sources) What kind of source of communication we used, for instance: instant messing, ICQ, IRC, which contact we have gather the information What are the prices for the above attacks. First of all, we must bear in mind that collecting the above information it is presented to a numerous affected sources ( i.e. Website, news, forums, IRC chat,etc.). By visiting the source can lead you to a virus, trojan, malicious code, malware, etc. Which can damage your system. Therefore, we are going to use virtual environment to find our demands. In addition, we will use different languages and different search engines. Construction of report is separated by tasks section. Where each section is presented with the source, communication type and the costs of the service. In addition, in Appendix 1 we give the configuration of virtual environment. Finally the conclusion made of all collected data will be concise in conclusion section. TASKS Following list is the numeration of the tasks: DDoS Credit Card Numbers Infected Machines Spam for 1 000 000 people TASK 1 Source where we can find information about the cost of DDoS attacks are provided in Russian most known [Hackzone] forum.

I have try so hard to find infected machine price, but until today, I did not come up with any good source. Therefore, I would like if it is possible to add this source and discuss this source and information with the fellow students. TASK 4 Spamming for one million people it sounds impossible, but still out there someone is offering this service. Here is from Kazakhstan source with the following information, translated in English: E-mail newsletter:1 post = 1 m., minimum order 10 000 posts.For large orders – big discounts!At present there is action: 10 000 tenge, we send 20 000 messages. + Action: 50 000 tenge, we send your letter to 360 000 email ardesov in Almaty, send 3 times in one month!The action is over, send a time.E-mail database:In Almaty:60 000 LEGAL Address – Almaty Yuredicheskie email addresses, the entire directory guide \"our town\" and directory site \"Samruk Kazyna\"430 000 – private address Almaty residents collected via mail search agent criteria:country, city, gender, age.Throughout Kazakhstan:240 000 – LEGAL person Kazakhstan LLP, Ltd., Inc., Ltd., etc. collected from various references such as \"yellow pages\" \"compass\" etc.3.4 million – individuals, all of Kazakhstan. – Collected through the mail search agent criteria: country, city, gender, age.P.S. you can build a base of email addresses to any city in Kazakhstan, or any other city in any other country, can you give us the criteria and we will collect your base, an example of criteria:I try, the city, Age, sex, online, not online.P.S. Legal mailings are engaged for 3 years, dispatching more than 5 years.To Order: +7-701-1**5575, +7 (727) -329-61-**.E-mail: d**z@i**ox.ru Indeed, for 10 000 KZT = 67.45 USD and the amount of message send are 20 000 spam. Then the price for one million spam is 3.372.5 USD without discount. The above links is from the following source [Rassilka.kz]. CONCLUSION I would like to generalize that from the above information we see that for any service that we looked for, it has a price. Value that are different in other countries and currencies. Yet, before you start this research make sure that you are not using your local machine. Likewise, I have used an virtual environment to be able to collect all the above data. Because the sites, forums, links, etc. are infected with malicious code, or can be easily traceable. In summary, we utter gather as much as possible different sources and different prices. Most expensive is the spam for one million people, second is DDoS attacks and never the last is to gain an credit card numbers from different countries and different price. For more info please refer to following source [QuinStreet Inc] why I have chose Russia as the main source. APPENDIX Appendix 1 is configuration of the virtual environment.

Virtual life is a catchall term used to describe the involvement and presence of an individual in any chosen virtual world or simulated digital environment. Virtual world is a genre of online community that often takes the form of a computer-based simulated environment, through which users can interact with one another and use and create objects. And virtual community is a social network of individuals who interact through specific media, potentially crossing geographical and political boundaries in order to pursue mutual interests or goals. Therefore, we have choose this problem as an issue of the general drastically grow of the population of having access to the computers and Internet. There are many online service available to demonstrate an virtual life environment for different purpose, for example: http://secondlife.com/ , http://ict-virtuallife.eu/ , etc. Nowadays the scholars and researchers are organizing workshops and developing projects, to understand the meaning of second life and to perceive the meaning of virtual life in different aggregate of surroundings. The interesting topics about the second life – virtual life are that it can be focus in many different aspects, example: virtual distance education, on users – questionnaire on user needs, it can be compression of virtual life with an second life, online shopping, medical purpose, social networking, cross cultural study, modern world with GPS cell phones, etc. According to the literature, people tend to construct their virtual identity in a different way from the real one. Therefore, it is extremely important to study both the aspects of the everyday life and the presentation of the virtual self (Nagy, Péter, 2010). In summary, we are going to give an expectations and the comparison in past few years and nowadays, what have change, what is expecting in the future, etc. In addition we are devoting and explaining what are the best methods in our opinion to be done to study the problem in a deep allegory. But on the other hand we are openhanded in impression what kind of problems could rise do to analyze this problem in the field of Internet psychology. Expectations First of all, a general increase of people using the Internet (maybe not so strong as some years ago but still really dynamic), and a decreasing of the average age of the users (Internet is really used among very young people, thanks to all the social network really in fashion at the present time). There are other data that we expect from our research project, especially about the using of the Internet divided in the continents. Of course in Asia there are more users than in any other place, but we have to consider that this one is the most populated continent between all the others… We can in this way expect the statistics of the world Internet penetration rate: Reading these two graphics we can compare the quantity of people using the Internet in general and the penetration grade of the Internet in the last years, according to different continents. So we can verify that even in continents with very few users of the Net there has been a very strong increase of the users in the last period (Oceania is the last continent about numbers of users of the Internet with around 21 millions, but with a penetration rate of about 61% in last years, the second one between all the other continents). In Europe this phenomenon of the spreading of the usage of the Internet is really strong, as we can see for other data (really superior than in the rest of the world). A last statistic that we expect from our research, this time about the usage of Internet by young people: the case is only local (United States) but it's significant of the increasing of the usage of Internet in last years. About 80% of children between the ages of 0 and 5 who use the Internet in the United States do so on at least a weekly basis. The report, which was assembled using data from seven recent studies, indicates that young children are increasingly consuming all types of digital media, in many cases consuming more than one type at once. A 2010 Nielsen study suggests that 36% of children between the ages of 2 and 11 uses the computer system and the Internet massively. Altogether, children between the ages of 8 and 10 spend about 5.5 hours each day using computers. Methods First we will start with the method of analyzing influences between virtual and real life and afterwords analyzing the influences between virtual life can be done in a very wide variety of ways. Questionnaires can be used to analyze users own believes on the influences. For example a questionnaire can be used to study how the user thinks his Internet activity has affected his social behavior in the real world. Questionnaires can be conducted via social networks or separate Internet applications, which make them an easy way to gather information. In the modern world with GPS cell phones, the analysis can also be made objectively with brute data analysis. People could be studied by gathering information from their social network pages and by using some GPS tracking software on their mobile phones. This way we can gather both the amount of time used in social networks and the amount of time spend in the real world. If the GPS tracking can be done in a large enough scale we can also see how many people a person meets during a certain time period. Third kind of a study could be a cross cultural study, where behaviors between different cultures are compared to see how virtual life changes the behavior. This doesn't only mean spatial comparison, but also the temporal comparison of Estonian culture in the year 1950 compared to 2010. This of course means that we must have a good knowledge of the cultures before we make decisions on which changes are due to the second life. The cultural study would be good to conduct on a culture, where the Internet will be introduced in the following years. This way we can see the changes in 10 years. Problems that could occur There are obviously many problems that must be well thought before continuing with the study. In the questionnaire choosing the group, questions and the way to analyze the results will have a fairly big impact on the conclusions. Because the group is huge and diverge (all the Internet users in the world), it will be quite hard to predict anything. Problems with following people objectively is of course quite illegal in almost all of the modern countries with Internet. This will effect the group that can be followed, since we only get people who wants to be followed. Because we only get a special subset of people to study, we only can guarantee that the results we get applies to the people who likes to be studied. Cross-cultural studies are hard to compare, since there is quite a huge number of variables that effect in human behavior, and it is usually close to impossible to determine accurately which behavioral differences would be due to virtual life. Conclusion The aim of our research project is mainly to try to reconsider a topic that can seem really banal (second life? every research about the Internet starts from second life!), but that we consider to be of ground importance. It's really important to keep monitored every short period of time these data; that's the only way to have a clear vision of the topic to start further and more specific researches. Consequently, from all the above we can make a conclusion that it is possible to have done this research through many methods and still there are going it be rise many problems. The problems can be mainly in cross-culture, and the social differences between one group and the other. Reference Nagy, Péter (2010). Second Life, Second Choice?

To understand the present we must first understand the past. The Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like nothing before. The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities. The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without regard for geographic location. The Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the benefits of sustained investment and commitment to research and development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology (Barry M. , et al., 2011). The Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the initial prototype of what is often called the National (or Global or Galactic) Information Infrastructure. Its history is complex and involves many aspects – technological, organizational, and community. And its influence reaches not only to the technical fields of computer communications but throughout society as we move toward increasing use of online tools to accomplish electronic commerce, information acquisition, and community operations(Barry M. , et al., 2011). Likelihood, computers have changed the face of communication to an extent that we can't consider our routine life without presence of these machines. With the availability of technologies like internet, instant messaging, emailing and others, the computers has fast replaced conventional means of communicating with each other(Communication Type, 2008). No one writes letter anymore. It's been said that longhand or cursive is no longer taught in grade school. No need for it. People don't write anymore. As technology defined the late Twentieth Century, we became both closer together and further apart. People had more time for an online chat via the fast growing Internet than they did for a day at the park with a dear friend. That was bad. On the other hand, we connected to people all over the world that we might not otherwise get to enjoy. Today, computer technology constantly changes the way we communicate (Friends of Time, 2011). When we look through the history of computer communication from 1968 to nowadays there are three unique market sectors: Data Communication, Networking and Internet (Internetworking). Data communication is an electronic transmission of information that has been encoded digitally (as for storage and processing by computers). Computer Networking is an interconnection of various computer systems located at different places. In computer network two or more computers are linked together with a medium and data communication devices for the purpose of communicating data and sharing resources. When the Internet is a network of networks? Millions of computers all over the world are connected through the Internet. Computer users on the Internet can contact one another anywhere in the world. If your computer is connected to the Internet, you can connect to millions of computers. You can gather information and distribute your data. It is very much similar to the telephone connection where you can talk with any person anywhere in the world. As digital media takes flight, the grand slam of computer communication has arrived. Skype . It's free, it's live, and it's real face time. Not only can people talk, but they can see each other as they talk. There are even Skype and \"skype-like\" apps for Smartphones. To an extent, communication has a more human feel again. People can see friends and family a world away and keep very close contact. And leave it to teenagers to figure out how to make Skype the new bedroom powwow. Teenagers simply turn it on and hang out. They may not even be talking to each other, but they know the other person is there (Friends of Time, 2011). With a free access of the Internet though the wireless local area network (WLAN 1) we can chat and talk with anyone from anywhere, without the consideration of graphical location. The internet and computers are offering a wide range of communication influence. We can communicate to text messages to your friends through computers and communication tools provided by it. From emails and newsletters to text chats and instant messaging, micro-blogging, computers can help you to reach your friends, relatives, business associates and others in the matter of few seconds. Communication tools to communicate your voice messages without facing the geographical restrictions. Voice mails and voice chats, brought revolutionary changes how have computers changed the way we communicate. Business communication with the help of audio and video conferencing. The executives of different branches of a company, located in different geographical locations, can communicate with each other and distances can pose no hurdles in establishing these communication systems. Other influence of computer communication are helping and proving the education system of offering a distant learning, gaining a degree without being at the university location, etc. One of the popular concepts in nowadays communication is online social networking, instance of communication, joining different online clubs and communicates with individuals from various parts of the world. On the other hand, imagine a day without computer in your room or on the office desk. For instance no emails, no chatting, no instant messaging and no web camera interactions, how we are going to feel? Therefore, we all can understand how computers have changed the way we communicate. Life can come to a standstill without computers and similar devices around us. Consequently, communication through computers is an important aspect of every individual today. The best part of communicating through computer and Internet is that you can practice it from any part of the world. All computer technology is wonderful and the more access to communication the better. But it will be a shame if the world becomes so shrouded in technology that good old fashioned face to face people skills become a rare art instead of an everyday norm. In summary, all the above describes how the computers changed the way we communicate. This is because computers have become great contributors towards the world of communication.

Is there a psychological \"digital divide\"? Are people who often use the Internet psychologically different from those who do not and in what ways? The Internet is changing the average citizens as much as did other technologies, for instance: telephone, TV, computers, mobile phones etc. The mainly province was to help the science, engineering, and business. Many scholars, technologists, and social critics believe that these changes and the Internet, in particular, are transforming economic and social life (Robert , Micheal, Vicki, Sara, Tridas , & William , 1998). In the past few years, the scholars have done many researches to make a conclusion of difference in psychological and social tend of the Internet to the citizens. Therefore, the term \"digital divide\" is the gap that exists between those who have access to electronic and Information Technology – Internet and those who do not (University of Minnesota Duluth, 2011). People use home computers and the Internet in many different ways and for many purposes, including entertainment, education, information retrieval, and communication. If people use the Internet mainly for communication with others through e-mail, distribution lists, multiuser dungeons, chats, and many other instant or voice messenger applications, they might do so to augment traditional technologies of social contact, expanding their number of friends and reducing the difficulty of coordinating interaction with them. On the other hand, these applications disproportionately reduce the costs of communication with geographically distant acquaintances and strangers; as a result, a smaller proportion of people's total social contacts might be with family and close friends. Yet other applications on the Internet, particularly the World Wide Web, provide asocial entertainment that could compete with social contact as a way for people to spend their time (Robert et al., 1998). On the one hand, since the primary use of the Internet is communication, some people might speculate that the Internet will have positive social consequences in people's everyday lives because it increases the frequency and quality of interpersonal communications among people. People with easy access to others would feel better connected and more strongly supported by others, leading to happiness and engagement in families, organizations, communities, and society more generally (Nikolovska, 2007). But, on the other hand, the ease of electronic communication may lead to weaker social ties, because people have less reason to leave their homes and actually interact face to face with other people. The Internet allows people to more easily work from their home, to form and sustain friendships and even romantic attachments from their home, to bank from their home, to vote and engage in political and social issue based discussions with others (from home) (Nikolovska, 2007). Even with watching television and using a home computer and the Internet generally imply physical inactivity and limited face-to-face social interaction. Some studies, including our own, have indicated that using a home computer and the Internet can lead to increased skills and confidence with computers (Lundmark, Kiesler, Kraut, Scherlis, & Mukhopadhyay, 1998). However, when people use these technologies intensively for learning new software, playing computer games, or retrieving electronic information, they consume time and may spend more time alone (Vitalari, Venkatesh, & Gronhaug, 1985). Some cross-sectional research suggests that home computing may be displacing television watching itself (Danko, W. D. & MacLachlan, J. M, 1983), (Kohut, 1994) as well as reducing leisure time with the family (Vitalari et al., 1985). In this variety of ways, Internet communications can potentially displace face-to-face communications. This point is important because psychologists in many researches have described and proved such face to face and telephone connections as being of higher quality, when viewed in terms of their contribution to satisfaction and well-being(Nikolovska, 2007). Question that rise is while our culture heralds the Internet as a technological wonder; there are suggestions that Internet use has a negative influence on individuals and their social skills. A recent study conducted by Carnegie Mellon University concludes that Internet use leads to small but statistically significant increases in misery and loneliness and a decline in overall psychological well-being(Association, American Psychological, 1998). The appropriately named HomeNetproject studied a sample of 169 people in Pittsburg during their first year or two online. Data showed that as people in this sample used the Internet more, they reported keeping up with fewer friends. They also reported spending less time talking with their families, experiencing more daily stress, and feeling more lonely and depressed. These results occurred even though interpersonal communication was their most important reason for using the Internet. Katz and Aspden's national survey (1997) is one of the few empirical studies that have compared the social participation of Internet users with nonusers. Controlling statistically for education, race, and other demographic variables, these researchers found no differences between Internet users' and nonusers' memberships in religious, leisure, and community organizations or in the amount of time users and nonusers reported spending communicating with family and friends. From these data, Katz and Aspden concluded that \"[f]ar from creating a nation of strangers, the Internet is creating a nation richer in friendships and social relationships\" (p. 86)(Robert et al., 1998). Furthermore, the percentage of usage of the technology nowadays drastically enhanced. Such as the state/country statistics of information society reports during pass few years. Parallel between two countries with a similarity of population number: Estonia and Macedonia Estonia since 2000 had 366,600 connected citizens though Internet. However, in 2010 the statistic report's the rapidly changes with the number of 969,700 connections (Miniwatts Marketing Group., 2010). Yet the statistic in Macedonia shows since 2000 the users that were connected are 30,000, where in 2010 the number swiftly has change, 1,057,400 users in the country were connected though Internet. Thus, the statistic shows that 75,1% of citizens in Estonia has access to Internet, analogous to Macedonia 51% of population of the country in final report of 2010 (Miniwatts Marketing Group, 2010). As a result, from the statistic we can see that, most of the population nowadays has a computer, laptop, or device in their pocket that can connect on Internet. Despite the alarm, research indicates most children are doing fine. Computers are certainly intriguing and captivating, and the Internet is most assuredly alluring with its research and communicative capacities. But overall, technology can be considered a positive enhancement to growth(Affonso, 1999). This feature is eloquently affirmed by author Don Tapscott (Tapscott, 1999): \"… when kids are online, they're reading, thinking, analyzing, criticizing and authenticating – composing their thoughts. Kids use computers for activities that go hand-in-hand with our understanding of what constitutes a traditional childhood. They use the technology to play, learn, communicate and form relationships as children always have. Development is enhanced in an interactive world.\" From the above the influence of the Internet has caused a change in the way we communicate, study, shop, etc. The most famous for the ability to spread information, to communicate from a distance with a web camera, etc. it is the Internet. But this communication revolution changed the pure nature of interpersonal and group processes. We should be able to see the difference between the qualities of face-to-face communication that influence the impact of communication on people and their social interaction. Moreover, should we be able to predict the probable influence of any new communication technology. Nevertheless, the researchers show that people sooner or later convert their cyber contacts into more traditional face-to-face, as most of us do. People use the Internet, in other words to help them achieve their real-life goals. And rather than technology's changing people's social and psychological reality, in other words, people change their use of technology to facilitate their creation of a desired social reality.

Thus, in other words the collectivistic culture beside. Cultures by the membership are typically divided into two categories: collectivist and individualist. Individualistic cultures, people are expected to develop and display their individual personalities and to choose their own affiliations, where in collectivist cultures, people are defined and act mostly as members of a long-term group, such as the family, a religious group, an age cohort, a town, or a profession, among others (Deb, 2011). Moreover, individualism pertains to societies in which ties are loose: people are expected to look after themselves and their immediate family. In addition, collectivism pertains to societies in which people are integrated into strong, cohesive groups from birth onwards, protecting them in exchange for unquestioned loyalty (Hall, Menno, & Steehouder, 2004). Cross-cultural studies have provided empirical evidence that the individualism-collectivism dimension is the most important dimension for pinpointing differences between cultures (Ting-Toomey & Gao, 1998). Furthermore, both collectivist and individualist cultures have their failings. People in individualist cultures are susceptible to loneliness, and people in collectivist cultures can have a strong fear of rejection (Psychology Wiki, 2011). Specifically the emphasize of groups in family and work goals in collectivist cultures, such as those of East Asia, parts of Latin America and some countries from Europe, like: Greece and Portugal (Psychology Wiki, 2011). To illustrate the traits of collectivism is that each person is encouraged to conform to society, to do what is best for the group and do not openly express opinions or beliefs that go against it; group, family or rights for the common good seen as more important than the rights of individuals; where rules promote stability, order, obedience; fitting in or conforming to group or society is required; where distinctions made between in-group and out-group and working with others and cooperating is the norm. Refusal to cooperate and wanting to be independent or stand out is seen as shameful. Everyone must rely on others for support. Therefore, stereotype of a ‘good person' in collectivist cultures is trustworthy, honest, generous, and sensitive, all characteristics that are helpful to people working in groups (Psychology Wiki, 2011). At the present day, users of the online social networks are more collectivistic, because of the apparent benefits to networked interaction. Given this rise in popularity, a significant amount of prior work has examined the social behavior and attitudes of the users that engage in Internet network. Proponents argue that community building technology is useful because it improves knowledge interaction among users, enhancing interpersonal relationships. Specifically as weblogs, playing online or through Internet network games, wikis such as Wikipedia, social networking such as Facebook, Myspace, Hi5, etc. and micro blogging tools such as Twitter, in particular, have attracted attention ( Dayne, Sigi, & Hart, 2009). For instance, I do not know all of my friends in my social networks Facebook, last.fm, twitter, myspace, etc. Yet I do like to build a community where I can share my other activities, such as sharing my new photography that I have taken in Estonia or somewhere else, share the event when I am going to perform a music show in clubs in Tartu or Tallinn. Sharing links of my new blog posts or my site update. Therefore, still I have seen this people face to face, or at least I have had a face to face conversation with most of them. I do rely on their support to show in events that I am performing, or get a feedback on the photography that I have posted recently. All the above, creates my own society group network though Internet my own virtual world family, where relationship permits classification in the in-group, which relied on collectivistic culture. On the other hand, when collectivists meet another person, the first thought they are likely to have is, \"What is my relationship with that person?\" If the relationship permits classification in the in-group, they are likely to behave very positively – cooperating, supporting, going out of their way to help. In contrast, if the other person is classified as an out-group member, they are likely to be indifferent or even hostile. Such sharp differentiation of in-group and out-group is not found among individualists. Collectivists use action verbs, rather than state verbs, because they prefer to use context in their communications. Sometime even show a generosity rule when exchanging with in-group members, where their acceptance of paternalism and to emphasize the importance of the nurturance of the leader. And for further more information see (Individualism and Collectivism, 2001, p. 35). Therefore, the Internet drastically changes the psyche in-group and out-group communication, relationship, supporting, cooperation, etc. in human culture. Nevertheless, Internet has influence on psyche in collectivist culture behaviors but affects the individualist. Nowadays people are communicating through the many sources available on Internet and develop new relationships, groups and community where they can share and feel positive, classified, into larger groups.

What are the most significant changes? What has remained unchanged? Before we start the discussion about the major changes in warfare from antiquity to present day we will precede with definition of War and its significant and remained unchanged changes. WAR in its literal meaning is fighting, for fighting alone is the efficient principle in the manifold activity which, in a wide sense, is called war. But fighting is a trial of strength of the moral and physical forces by means of the latter. That the moral cannot be omitted is evident of itself, for the condition of the mind has always the most decisive influence on the forces employed in war (Graham, 2002). Humanity has wedged war since antiquity through nowadays for million causes, national and religious freedom, hatred, grudge, human rights, liberating the enslaved etc. But one principle in war has always been present from the depths of history till today, that is, wars are fought for one purpose only, conquest of new territory from which economic benefit is to be acquired for the soul use of the conqueror. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the armed clashes of the beginning of the XXI century, when under the pretext of human rights countries are being robed from their natural resources and air-raids are killing those whom should protect. After we met with the theory of war and moral principles, it is time to consider changes that have occurred between the ancient and modern times. The military of ancient Egypt had introduced the new technologies of metal, where they used bronze in the Middle Kingdom as main weapons source, after it changed to iron in the New Kingdom and all during the Late Dynastic Period. The Old Kingdom soldiers were equipped with a great variety of weapons: shields, spears, cudgels, maces, daggers, bows and arrows. The New Kingdom carried spears, battle axes, sickleswords (MdC transliteration: xpS – khepesh or khopesh) and daggers. After the bowmen, either on foot or on chariots, had softened up the enemy forces with a shower of arrows (Dollinger, Dynasties XVIII to XX, 2004), the infantry would rush in, breaking their ranks with hand weapons, maces with wooden handles and stone – later metal – heads, battle axes, hatchets, clubs, swords, sickleswords and daggers (Dollinger, Weapons, 2010). Persian Army had only three wars, started from 490 BC until 478BC, the army was very multicultural, were organizes in a decimal basis, regiments, units and corps were grouped in tens, hundreds and thousands (Drury, 2006). Officers were being responsible for ten men, another for one hundred, one thousand and ten thousand. Heavily equipped with weapons, which are: Thrusting Spear, palta, Akinakes , Xiphos, kopis, bow etc (Wildfiregames, 2004). Greece war, first nine years of the war consisted of both war in Troy and war against the neighbouring regions, where destroyed Trojan economy, allowed Greeks to getter a large amount of resources. The Greeks won most of the battles, but they still could not break the walls of Troy. The weapons that were used in those battles were bows and arrows. As for strategies the famous Trojan horse, when Odysseus had a perfect idea to build a big wooden horse where inside will be field with the soldiers, which bring and invasion of Troy from the Greeks (Rita, 2010). Army of Macedonia was the army of ancient Kingdom of Macedonia. It considers a grate military force where there were reforms constructed from the suggestion of King Philip II of Macedon and then his son Alexander the Great. The introduction was in innovation of weapons and new tactics, along with unique elements combination of military elements, which bring a great intercontinental empire (Ellis, 1979). Philip II had implemented in Macedonian phalanx army separation which one group were on a mission to conquer a city and the other to conquer castles. Each phalangite carried as his primary weapon a sarissa, but the phalangite were not the focal point for the battle, they have used other forces like: skirmishers, range troops, reserves of allied hoplites, and artillery (Hellenica, 2005). Rome in the wars had adapted weapons, armour and tactics of many enemies they fought. Main weapons of Rome soldiers were Spanish sword – gladius, it had two throwing spears, a large shield, body armour and a helmet. They have also operated with the fire supported weapons, scorpios, carroballistas, onagers. For a fest moves they started to build bridges, so that the soldiers and the army can move faster. The army can march up to 30 km a day. They were very evil, trained to stab a 5 cm deep wound, after breaking the enemy, Romans tended to kill as many enemies as possible and their cavalry pursued fleeing enemy. After the Rome the medieval Europe warfare followed, which was the war of legal and acceptable justification, nobility (knights) and the main force on the battlefield was a heavy cavalry, where the law of the armed conflict was born. The second largest empire in human history was the Mongol empire. Mongols army had the capacity to move up to 150 km a day. The weapons of the army consisted of massive fire (bow) speed and manoeuvres. Wars of the XVI Century were mostly protracted and indecisive. There was insistency on building a fortress that was very difficult to conquer. The most important improvement is the side of the weapons with adoption of light guns and gunpowder. Gustavus Adolphus had guns in his army, he had 1 gun per 83, but his enemies had 1 gun per 2000 men. The main thing was to build and modify the fortresses for safety and hard to conquer. World War I, sometimes described as ‘the war to end all wars' (Creveld, 2000, p. 162), the strategies were based on first manoeuvre, and then attrition. Forces and armaments were infantry, cavalry artillery, and surface navy (initially); later – tanks, planes, submarines, chemical weapons. The tactics were manoeuvre, frontal assaults, fortified defence, artillery concentration (initially); the theoretical thinking: seeking the way out of dead end, but not finding the means and ways. The first known bombardment from the sky, using airplanes was by Bulgarian army on the 16 of October 1912 at battle of Adrianople, where they were captivated by the Turkish army. From the German newspaper \"Geschichte des Luftkriegs\", Militarverlag der DDR, Berlin, 1975, though the 1912 United Kingdom had 23 air planes, Russian – 99, German – 46, Italian – 22, Japan – 10 and USA – 3 air planes. Second World War, where the technology and the concept of the war were getting bigger, developed into a prolonged and extremely deadly struggle of attrition. The Germans invented the rockets (vau1 and vau2). Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the first and only events of deployments of nuclear weapons in the world. Second half of the 20th century, after the valuable technical point, the arms forward for an outbreak of terrorism. That means that wars are no longer big and global; the enemy is no longer in uniforman in force. And size is no longer as great as it was the enemy can attack from anywhere. Therefore, no longer wars head-do met the two armies, but running by partisan / guerillas. Terrorism is an unconventional war de facto, i.e. anti-insurgent operation, i.e. counter insurgency. Which create the kind of combat actions that are performed nowadays in Afghanistan and Iraq. In the 20th century, has one goal, redistribution of resources, i.e. to get to justify the need to test before the war for democracy and human rights. Macedonia is the country that is inclined towards terrorism, the early 20th century, April 28 1903rd in Thessaloniki, the boatmen of Thessaloniki have committed terrorist actions against the capital of Western Europe and Turkey, i.e. have planted bombs in the Ottoman Bank in Thessaloniki, the main post office, and planted a bomb in a ship (Sotros, 2004 December). As can read above the changes are very drastic. Humanity is fighting for the different purpose; starting from the antiquity to nowadays, not only in weapons that were used and presented, but in the strategies in a tactics and theoretical thinking. Therefore, there are no more battles wars, people are grouping and they can embattle from anywhere, which gives a content of the terroristic activities of the wars. Today the humanity and the scholars should getter together to work around of the problems and solutions for the future, possibilities of internet (social networks, VOIP, IM etc.), net generations1, thus today it is the main source of grouping the population for massive protests or any other actions, which can end-up to a war or scandal. Consequently the technology and science are rising, the possibilities and the changes in an aspect of wars will change. For instant is Russian – Georgian conflict in 2008 as a result of territorial attack and in sequence with it there was an cyber-attack in progress2; or powerful internet worm repeatedly targeted five nuclear industrial facilities in Iran and many others3. Therefore, nowadays this actions and concept of warfare is different, no more uniforms, battles etc. Warfare's are getting new aspect and new ways to approach through the technology.

The measures were made by custom script for Linux operating system, in our case the server side is Ubuntu server 10.04 LTS running on 32 bit system with 512MB Ram and testing platform Fedora 14 for more details see section appendixes. The laboratory task is to assist anyone else to be able to perform optimization in easy meaner to their blog, homepage, magazine, etc. without any advantage of technical knowledge. Presenting stepwise solution with installing firstly wordpress optimization cache plugin, secondary installing PHP solution for increasing the acceleration performance of the server and changing the permalinks settings to the CMS platform for higher optimization. All of the above solutions are free open source, and are taking care of the low budget. In addition providing measurement results with different scenarios will help us to get wide picture of how affective was optimization. METHODS Optimization of the access to wordpress CMS platform is done in behalf of three different scenarios have been proved while performance is getting slightly higher. Test script is measuring the response time of the link provided and it is recording the results in a text file. Which contains the three attends respondent time of the server. For each method we will provide the results in analyses section. The following steps should be done on the server side. METHOD 1 Installing procedure [WP-Super-Cache Installation], first method of wordpress plugin: WP Super Cache Version 0.9.9.9 In a terminal please type the following lines:wget -c http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/wp-super-cache.0.9.9.9.zipsudo apt-get install unzipunzip wp-super-cache.0.9.9.9.zipmv /home/[user]/wp-super-cache /var/www/wordpress/plugins In wordpress administration link: http://192.168.56.102/wordpress/ wp-admin , log in with the credentials, from the panel select Plugins -> WP-Super-Cache -> Activate . After the activation is done, go to Settings -> WP-Super-Cache , on the first tab activate the cache by selecting the On cache and on the Advance tab select only the \"(Recommended)\" settings. After your done, select Update Settings and on the bottom of the page you can see a red text that needs to be copy in one of the files that is located on the server. Connect to your server by FTP client and locate the .htaccess file on the wordpress directory and open it and paste the following lines and save the file: # BEGIN WPSuperCache <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>RewriteEngine On RewriteBase /wordpress/AddDefaultCharset UTF-8RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !&#94;.*[&#94;/]$RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !&#94;.*//.*$ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !POST RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} !.*=.*RewriteCond %{HTTP:Cookie} !&#94;.*(comment_author_|wordpress_logged_in|wp-postpass_).*$RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Wap-Profile} !&#94;[a-z0-9\\\"]+ [NC]RewriteCond %{HTTP:Profile} !&#94;[a-z0-9\\\"]+ [NC]RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !&#94;.*(2.0\\ MMP|240x320|400X240|AvantGo|BlackBerry|Blazer| Cellphone|Danger|DoCoMo|Elaine/3.0|Eu$ RewriteCond %{HTTP_user_agent} !&#94;(w3c\\ |w3c-|acs-|alav|alca|amoi|audi|avan|benq|bird| blac|blaz|brew|cell|cldc|cmd-|dang|doco$ RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-Encoding} gzip RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/wordpress/wp-content/cache/supercache/% {HTTP_HOST}/wordpress/$1/index.html.gz -f RewriteRule &#94;(.*)\"/wordpress/wp-content/cache/supercache/%{HTTP_HOST}/wordpress/ $1/index.html.gz\" [L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !&#94;.*[&#94;/]$RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !&#94;.*//.*$ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !POST RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} !.*=.*RewriteCond %{HTTP:Cookie} !&#94;.*(comment_author_|wordpress_logged_in|wp-postpass_).*$RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Wap-Profile} !&#94;[a-z0-9\\\"]+ [NC]RewriteCond %{HTTP:Profile} !&#94;[a-z0-9\\\"]+ [NC]RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !&#94;.*(2.0\\ MMP|240x320|400X240|AvantGo|BlackBerry|Blazer| Cellphone|Danger|DoCoMo|Elaine/3.0|Eu$ RewriteCond %{HTTP_user_agent} !&#94;(w3c\\ |w3c-|acs-|alav|alca|amoi|audi|avan|benq|bird| blac|blaz|brew|cell|cldc|cmd-|dang|doco$ RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/wordpress/wp-content/cache/supercache/% {HTTP_HOST}/wordpress/$1/index.html -f RewriteRule &#94;(.*) \"/wordpress/wp-content/cache/supercache/%{HTTP_HOST}/wordpress/ $1/index.html\" [L] </IfModule># END WPSuperCache METHOD 2 The second approach is to install an PHP accelerator and optimizer [EAccelerator Installing from source]. The main goal is to increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in their compiled state. Which will augment the acceleration applied with method 1. Therefore, please follow the steps to install from source code eAccelerator [2]. sudo apt-get install php-devwget -c http://ignum.dl.sourceforge.net/project/eaccelerator/eaccelerator/eAccelerator%200.9.6.1/eaccelerator-0.9.6.1.tar.bz2tar xvfj eaccelerator-0.9.6.1.tar.bz2cd eaccelerator-0.9.6.1phpize./configuremakesudo make installsudo cp /eaccelerator-0.9.6.1 /etc/apache2/php.inisudo mkdir /tmp/eacceleratorsudo chmod 0777 /tmp/eacceleratorsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart After you have completed the above steps it is good way to test the php if the eaccelerator is working and correctly installed. In any case, please create a file called info.php on your wordpress directory with the following code inside: Access the link to your server vie the link http://192.168.56.102/wordpress/info.php. If you see the configuration information and details of PHP, the quickest way is to search for eaccelerator, and if the result is positive, most lightly you have installed eaccelerator correctly. METHOD 3 After we have completed the first and second methods it is time to grow the interactiveness of our wordpress project. Therefore, we will change setting to wordpress configuration where will speed-up the performance [Using Permalinks]. If can still add more optimization and acceleration applications, yet this laboratory report is performed only with three easy and maintained steps. Please log in to the wordpress administration panel, and on Settings -> Permalinks select Default . After the step is done, then we need to edit the .htaccess file and add the following lines at the end of the file and please save it: # BEGIN WordPressIfModule mod_rewrite.c>RewriteRule &#94;index\\.php$ - [L]RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-fRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-dRewriteRule . /wordpress/index.php [L]</IfModule># END WordPress ANALYSIS After completing each one of the method we should perform analysis of the system, were it will provide results of performance speed and can compare it if it is utter to improve the effectiveness of wordpress. Please refer to the appendix 3 to get the code of the script. Meanwhile the below show the results served pages per/second with three sets from the automatically created file from the custom script, named results_lab2.txt . Set1 Set2 Set3 Avg wordpress default 3.15 3.7 3.84 3.56 WP WP-super-cache + eaccelerator 26.48 44.34 45.68 38.83 WP WP-super-cache + eaccelerator 148.46 173.03 132.57 151.35 .htaccess default permalink + wp-super-cache + eaccelerator 158.57 1734.11 117.03 136.57 CONCLUSION From the analysis above we can see that performance has increased and wordpress project is more affectively respondent to our needs. Illustrations shows that wordpress as a default setting, clean installed and configure response with 3.15, 3.70 and 3.84 pages/per-second, which is not good enough to satisfaction. Similar to, after installation and configuration of wordpress plugin WP-Super-Cache we that notice that the performance slightly has grown but still the performance doesn't satisfied higher. However after implying the second method, installing eaccelerator the results drastically increased. From the above illustration we can see that the different methods produce different set results. Thus increasing changes performing different methods vs sets of pages/per-second are specified in the illustration 1. Finally the results were expected and demonstrating example how we can increase the addictiveness of wordpress performance and increase the respondent time pages view per/second. However, if we need to get higher effectiveness and response time for wordpress than should consider apply nginx[3] server and third party projects, applications to increase the optimization of wordpress. For instance good tutorial is on following blog [Howto hginx+php]. APPENDIXES Appendix 1 is for installation process of Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS and wordpress, mysql installation, other appendix 2 is for virtual machines configuration.

The event's title expressed its key question: what will Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) be like in the year 2020? (Harper, Tom, Yvonne, & Abigail, 2008, p. 8) The report that I have read it is divided in a four parts; Part 1 it is look back over the past 20 years or so; Part 2 it gives an outline how does changes are transforming the nature of our interaction with computers and the key questions that need to be addressed in the next 15 years as a result; Part 3 is concerned with HCI as a field of research and as a community of practitioners and designers; Part 4, recommendations, outlines specific suggestions for HCI in terms of how the field needs to be change. Therefore, the research report it talks about the future aspects and the future plans with an recommendations that has to be concern in an aspect of HCI, I have chosen to write about the part 4 where they give a good outline of the recommendations that has to be encounter for the new actions in the future of HCI. The research report came with very good seventh future directions. Each direction will be described in an educationally signification for me, what I have learned and what should be the next future actions in consideration. Matter of course, no one will know in what kind of aspects and future plans the HCI will change, but still this research report gives vaulting and most important future recommendations that need to be considered, and there will be more and more recommendations and future directions as the technology and the HCI changes. Before we start to talk about the recommendations in a field of HCI, let's see what HCI is. It is a term used to refer to the understanding and designing of different relationships between people and computers. In the late 1970's the main concern was usability. Since then, HCI has established and designed, developed and apply all manners to ensure that the technologies are easy to learn and easy to use. (Harper, Tom, Yvonne, & Abigail, 2008, p. 84) After getting familiar with the terms and the practice of HCI let as look though the main seventh future recommendations that were considered by the scholars and people involved in this forum. Recommendation 1: Revisit research and design methods in HCI: it is a distinct research area, methods and techniques have been used have altered over the years. Computer system and technologies are still in a way of changes, thus are the approaches for 2020 that needs to be considered: Explore new ways of understanding users. Over the last decade there have been techniques and design-based practices involving cultural probes. Usage of existing techniques of understanding that have emerged from scientific and engineering traditions, designs, views of diverse disciplines and cultural traditions; usage of conceptual analysis in the first stage of new HCI, where can comes from techniques of analytic philosophy and clarifying the systems of meaning and value of actions that are involved. Explore new ways of designing and making. Designing and making it takes a very important influence in a way of HCI. It is very important to comprehend for what, which and why the system is going to be used, what kind of users. In the future lightweight and prototypes should fit the designing and engineering solutions together. Should be developed new technological, prototype tool for the future development, and consider a test of hardware and software within every day. Reconsider how to evaluate digital technologies. Create a purpose of usage of the system, towards the, is it going to be used in everyday life in houses, working spaces or other environment. For what kind of usability the system is going to be used. For all should be made evaluation tools to reconsider the criteria and techniques. Recommendation 2: Be explicit about the remit of HCI. How far or whether the HCI as a research area should continue extend itself, or should be involved with interaction between people and digital technology, and should with concern itself more than in the past? Does are the question that should be raised. It should develop new design possibilities, future altering and crafting the landscape. Recommendation 3: Develop disciplinary techniques that allow HCI to collaborate with other research communities Disciplinary exchange. Requirement for HCI researchers to know how to converse with disciplines with very different traditions, they need to understand what philosophers can do and why philosophy is important. Example: economists. Beyond interdisciplinary boundaries. HCI should ask what might be the appropriate models for allowing interdisciplinary investigations to happen and it is an area where investment in research theories and approaches, in the elements of HCI competence and skill, and in the foundations of the philosophy of science are required. Recommendation 4: Teach HCI to the young. Children should be introduced to the ‘properties and possibilities of computing' it is the only way that they develop sufficient understanding of computing to enable them to be fully computer-literate when they are adults, and help them to shape the world in relation to technology. Recommendation 5: More advanced training for future HCI researchers. HCI professionals need to move outside of the scientific community they have lived within and find ways to engage with society as a whole. Recommendation 6: Engage with government, policy and society. More better technical and economical approach, where there will be wide range of implementing HCI in a government, but in policy and society. HCI should have a strong links with the society, it needs to interact more, not only like for policy in a trust and security in computer systems. Recommendation 7: Offer an inclusive future in 2020. By 2020, HCI will need to be able to design for and support differences in human value, irrespective of the economic means of those seeking those values. In this way, the future can be different and diverse because people want it to be. (Harper, Tom, Yvonne, & Abigail, 2008, pp. 78-83) I found this article very interesting, not only in an aspect of human interaction with computers but with the actions that were taken and the propositions that were sum. I love to make a summer of the entire research paper, but because of the short time period I could not make it. Still I gained my knowledge what should be expected and where are burrows in HCI field. It gives me a perfect view for the future implementation of projects, aspects and techniques that can be used. Hope that this few years since the 2007, the implementation and recommendation directories have been successfully. Reference Harper, R., Tom, R., Yvonne, R., & Abigail, S. (2008).

IP addresses are randomly chosen by the lecture. IP addresses: ​1. 69.163.171.238 ​2. 31.44.184.101 ​3. 188.72.228.69 External IP that is used for purpose of this test is following: 193.40.244.0/255 1. The ISP that provides this network is EENet2. Organization that is behind is Tallinn Technical University, Estonia. City location is Tallinn and the region is Harjumaa. The phone number of my ISP is: +372 73 * . The e-mail we should report abuse are: first persons that is in charge: Viktor Borisevitch (e-mail: tor at cc.ttu.ee and phone number: +372-2- *46) and Andres Lepp (e-mail: l at cc.ttu.ee and phone number: +372 6 * 55). In addition, if we wont to submit an abuse we should use both persons of network administration and then we can submit and security incident on the following ISP e-mail: turvas@eeenet.ee [RIPE NCC]. All in all, Method 1 and Appendix 1 describes the website, tools and application that are used to conduct this laboratory report. In addition, Method 2 and Appendix 2 will introduce website tools and databases where we can check if following IP's have been reported before as abuse and security risk. Both methods are represented with answer and consequences confront in the result section. Finally the conclusion made of all collected data will be concise in conclusion section of this report. METHODS First method describes and demonstrates web tools that have been used to collect the needed information from the stated IP's addresses. Second method is pointing out website tools and databases that can be applied if the IP has been reported previously as a abuse, spam or security threat. METHOD 1 Firstly, we need to collect as much as we can details about the IP address. In Appendix 1 is showing the wholly information of the IP's, contact details, organization name, address, location, state, country, technicians contact, abuse phone number, abuse e-mail, etc. Depending on the location of IP we should make sure that not only we know the ISP or abuse contact details, but we should know national CERT 3 agency that is in charge too. Therefore, to collect the information we have used different web sites, agencies: [RIPENCC, LACNIC, AfriNIC, APNIC, ARIN]. The above reference are agencies collected from IANA4. Authority responsible for global coordination of the Internet Protocol addressing systems [IANA]. Moreover, to have more details about the route of the IP's we are using command prompt in Windows 7 with the following command, where the results are presented in Appendix 2 section: tracert [0.0.0.0]To illustrate, the details information are presented in Result 1 section. METHOD 2 After we have collected the wholly information about the concrete IP proposals, we should check if in addition those IP's previously have been reported as abused, spam or security threat. To complete the following method we need to check concrete database system that is offering following service. First that crossed on web is [MalwareURL] which is dedicated to fighting malware, trojans and a multitude of other web-related threats. In addition, we can check if the IP addresses are listed in anti-spam databases. With other words blacklist check [MyIPAddress]. RESULTS Results from Method 1 are presented in Result 1, further Method 2 is presented in Result 2. RESULT 1 For each IP are presented only the most important data details that we need to collect for our goal. In addition, full description and details are presented in Appendix 1. The tables bellow are illustrating the most important information that we should look-for. In addition, the highlighted lines are indicating the abuse e-mail box that should be send mail too. 69.163.171.238OrgName: New Dream Network, LLCAddress: 417 Associated Rd.Address: PMB #257City: BreaStateProv: CAPostalCode: 92821Country: US#technician in chargeOrgTechName: Nagel, MarkOrgTechPhone: +1-714-706-4182OrgTechEmail: mna47-arin at dreamhost.com#abuse in chargeOrgAbuseName: DreamHost Abuse TeamOrgAbusePhone: +1-714-706-4182OrgAbuseEmail: abuse at dreamhost.comTable 131.44.184.101person: Chris Burnsaddress: Building 4>address: City West Office Parkaddress: Gelderd Roadaddress: Leeds LS12 6LXaddress: Englandphone: +44-208-901-2332#abuse e-mail: abuse-mailbox: abuse at laveconetworks.co.ukTable 288.72.228.69role: Mannesmann Arcor Network Operation Centeraddress: Arcor AG & Co.

If we look in details all of the IP's are from different countries. Therefore we need to find what is the national CERT agency contact details. First table is based in USA, therefore we need to use their reporting system, which is locate in the following link: http://www.us-cert.gov/ . Second table is UK, the national CERT agency link: www.ukcert.org.uk . Third table is based in Germany, the CERT agency link: http://www.cert-verbund.de/ . From the routing trace we can conclude that the first IP and the third respond and it did not miss route trace, where in the second IP, 31.44.184.101 there is miss route trace. That is why we will run this IP address to Method 2. Despite the fact, still we will run the rest of IP's in the Method 2, to be trusted that are not in the abuse list. RESULT 2 Next step is to attempt to search the IP address to check if they have been previously report as a abuse, trojan, malware, security threat, etc. To check and verify the security status we are using the service available [MalwareURL]. Where results for 69.163.171.238 and 88.72.228.69 are with status that have not been previously reported as abuse. On the other hand, 31.44.184.101 IP address is detected as an security threat before. More details are presented in Appendix 3. Where is demonstrating that the /404.php?type=stats&amp;affid=531&amp;subid=03&amp;iruns has been reported as malicious URL and it is in a blacklist of Google, MyWOT, etc. Not only that it is listed in the malware database list, but also if we double check on service [MyIPAddress] that the 31.44.184.101 IP address is listed in few blacklist which is assess by DNSBL5. CONCLUSION In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that the concrete IP's that we analysis in this report are demonstrating the process and methods that should be done in future to detect, report abuse, malware, threat, trojan, security risk, etc. Where we should gather the detail information, and to whom to turn the abuse. To be precise that are not in blacklist, spam list, etc. In spite of following IP's: 69.163.171.238 and 88.72.228.69, from performing methods and delivering results are safe and secure, still think can be exploited in easy manners. The opposite, IP address 31.44.184.101 it has been already report infected as malicious code from few blacklist providers. When checking the DNS, host name is linking to UK company that deals with IP Transit. For further information please check the following link: http://www.laveconetworks.co.uk/ . In general, hope that laboratory report and the analyse will help to anyone else to guide them for future use. APPENDIXES Appendix 1 is list of details collected from service.

What has changed? What has remained unchanged? How information society and information warfare influences achieving the victory? The rapid development of information technology (IT) over the past three decades has led to many changes for example in military and defense circles, social society, and economy in the information age. Nowadays many scholars are in a process of developing theories and concept of affective influence of victory in conflicts in the information age. In this essay the main discussions are about the interchanges of victory in conflict in the information age in aspect of divers' view of anatomy of information warfare; different views and approaches to information warfare/operation in a couple of countries, which will end with conclusion. Today, much of the enthusiasm for the information-led revolution in military affairs (RMA) or military transformation (as the newly preferred term of art), specifically in Gulf War model of decisive action appeared to demonstrate how total victory could be achieved reliably in the future (Gray, April 2002, p. 30). RMA's are immoderate, abrupt prose changes in paths of warfare waged and they are brought by development of technology and social changes. Therefore, in the end of Cold War development has formed the basis of RMA, where the present is usually defined as a transition to network-based/network-centric warfare (NCW), for instance: stealth technology, precision-guided munitions (PGM), computer technologies (Internet), etc. In addition the examples of implementing RMA are Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003) war, where they started as traditional conflicts and transformed into insurgencies. According to Carl von Clausewitz's book On War, \"War is an act of violence whose object is to compel the enemy to do our will\". Yet, 2000 years earlier Sun Tzu, established a benchmark for a mastery of war \"To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.\" Underlying those statements is an appreciation of the psychology of war. Indeed, by combining the statements Commander Randall G. Bowdish made a dissent statement of information age psychological operations \"to compel the enemy to do our will without fighting. (Bowdish, December1998 – February 1999)\". Another view made by other commander remark \"In war there can be no substitute for victory.\" General Douglas MacArthur, 1951 (Gray, April 2002). Nevertheless, the history of 20th century sufficesto remind us that there are many ways to win a war, but still various ways are not equivalent, and final victory does not necessarily belong to the side that dictates the conditions of peace. Which lends to viewpoint of how should we determine whether the victory is at hand, and define the time end of major battlefield to see if the post-war payoffs have been archived. Yet, there are moral considerations, archiving peace, e.g. humanitarian intervention, fair treatment may accelerate cessation of hostilities and surrender and law of armed conflict sets strict rules of behaviours by using weapon systems, treatment of prisoners, etc. Therefore, in the past, before World War I, there are fewer clear victories, of 311 wars from 1480 to 1970; only 137 wars were concluded with a peace treaty. Specifically, after World War II, almost 50% of the wars have been followed by a renewed fighting after initial cessation of hostilities. But, since the end of Cold War acceptability of armed force have continued and even escalated, particularly in open political systems. Such as, globalization is a strong impediment waging a total war. Therefore, today in the era of democracy, wars are hard to start, but even harder to bring to an end. Nowadays, the modern wars/information warfare consists on different vector of victory. Today is unacceptable to have extreme violence, such as losing small wars. Thus, victory today has changed drastically and vector consists of six aspects: informational(e.g. intelligence in internal and external sources, protection of information system with manipulation or disruption of its enemy), military (e.g. military security, action itself, enemy's attack against the action and defense for the action against enemy's attack), political (e.g. political stability, national interests, etc.) , economical (e.g. rebuilding of economical infrastructure, integration into the regional and global economy, trading of shares), social (e.g. ethnic, religious, nationalistic, social society violence to resolve in internal and external conflicts) and diplomatic (e.g. involving reliable approval and tangible support for the war outcome from the victory domestic public, foreign allies, international organizations and other observers) (Ahvenainen, January 2000). As a consequence these changes mean decreased importance of nation states, increased importance of virtual reality, network organizations and dominance of economy, information, technical intelligence and other information and network based organizations (Ahvenainen, January 2000). Another change in information age is terrorism. Information age terrorism may take on three distinct forms: conventional terrorism, technoterrorism, and cyberterrorism. The purpose weapons of the cyberterrorist are not designed to kill people or break physical objects. Rather, they exist exclusively to destroy or modify computer data. The weapons and the targets are the electrons moving within cyberspace. While it is possible to attack this data without any human interfaces, the human is usually the weakest link in a computer system (Littleton, December 1996). To illustrate historically, there have been observed four waves of modern terrorism:1880-1920: anarchist terrorism (began in Russia), 1920-1960: terrorism in support of national liberation (IRA, Irgun, PLO), 1960-1980: neo-leftist terrorism (Action Directe, BrigateRosso, Rote ArmeeFraktion) and 1980-present: religious terrorism (Hamas, al-Qaeda, Islamic Jihad) (Cronin & James , 2004). On the other hand of information terrorism there is modern insurgency, likelihood counterinsurgency. Modern insurgency is supported by a wide variety of non-state actors from abroad and it consists of many foreign/local society fighters in addition to local population. They still need support of the local population, but as it does not aspire for straight military victory. Nowadays insurgency, could be weaker than previous generations (hence the use of terrorism) as there are no powerful states directly behind it and they disseminate information about its activities all over the world, which does not rely only on official mass-media, it also uses of effectively Internet (Hammes & T., July-August 2006). Analogous to, strategic asymmetry in modern counterinsurgency (CI) and modern insurgency (I) are respectful goals. Like, (CI) victory means building up a stable state less than (I) getting rid of victorious state/coalition. As to win, (CI) needs \"hearts and minds\" of the majority of population, rather than (I) needs support of sufficient part of population. For instance, (CI) must deal successfully with tactical military activities to provide security, where (I) need to be successful only to a certain extent – inflicted casualties attack the will of (CI's) strategic leadership. More (CI) must win, less (I) must persuade(CI) that winning is impossible. Due to winning state building takes time, whereas persuading could happen fast. Therefore, evolution of insurgency in the information age is into persuasion/communication campaign which naturally increased resort to terrorism and relying on external support of non-state actors. Opposite to strategic victory of counterinsurgent arises from series of tactical victories and a state build-up, whereas only one tactical victory of insurgent might in the worst case lead to a strategic victory – withdrawal of the coalition. Nowadays, we can see seven different species of information warfare: command and control warfare, C2W (or C4I – command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (Joint Publication 1-02, 8 November 2010)); intelligence-based warfare, IBW; electronic warfare, EW; psychological warfare, PSYOP; hacker warfare, HW; economical information warfare, ECOIW and netwar / cyberwar (Lubicki, 3 August 1995). Therefore, different types of IW, first add the power of conventional warfare, which create new means of victory and defeat. Next, more important are possibilities to change the entity of warfare in a way that tanks, airplanes and HF -radios changed the warfare between the world wars. Today the best aspect of IW is the American doctrine in military adaptation and Information Operations (IO) (Ahvenainen, January 2000), which is going to be discussed in the following lines, comparing with view aspects of IW in China. Different countries, different approaches in process of implementation of IW, US, China and Russia, are intense examples. First US views in IO are to complementing traditional military means and allowing influencing enemy decision-making. More or less, Chinese views in IW are tool to compensate for their military inferiority and accelerate their economic development, which could enable the country to expert control over many developments in the world. Then US has series of offensive IO's, but has been in trouble in accommodating to modern information society where the enemy can attack directly the will of state national leadership. Opposite, Chinese military in IW are focused on the person of enemy commander and strives to alter his decisions and perceptions. Consequently, US strength in the IO fields is in its technical capabilities and weakness in seeking excessive control and understanding various cultures and capabilities to include EW , CNO and tradition PSYOPS, MILDEC , OPSEC . Where Chinese are attempting to mobilize its population in accordance with the concept of people's war in capabilities in development in CNA, especially CNR , CND, which bring worries of the danger of globalization (Pufeng, Spring 1995), (Anderson, The first edition 2001), (Bowdish, December1998 – February 1999). Nerveless, the IW for Soviet Union and subsequently to Russia its means ranging from controlling own society to demoralizing the enemy, gathering intelligence and attacking the enemy through CNO. There taking step further, where we had dealing with enemy with technology in US and thinking in China, Russia is trying to manipulate the biological parts of the enemy dealing with information (Liaropoulos, 2007). As a result, the information age is creating or will create new means of influence and new ends to influence. This process will create new means of victory, new troops and added complexity. It is important, that these new things will add new possibilities between war and peace and it will increase possibilities to act before war and to avoid conventional warfare (Ahvenainen, January 2000). Finally, to achieve victory in information warfare, the central issue is the control of information. Such as, Chinese approaches to use old tactics and strategies to win victory in information warfare and Russia is educating talented people and facilities to produce high quality cyber warriors for state, private business and crime.
