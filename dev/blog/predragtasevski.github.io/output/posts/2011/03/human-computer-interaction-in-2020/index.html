		<p>In March 2007, Microsoft Research organised the “HCI 2020” meeting at the El Bulli Hacienda Hotel near Seville, Spain. The event’s title expressed its key question: what will Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) be like in the year 2020? (Harper, Tom, Yvonne, &amp; Abigail, 2008, p. 8) The report that I have read it is divided in a four parts; Part 1 it is look back over the past 20 years or so; Part 2 it gives an outline how does changes are transforming the nature of our interaction with computers and the key questions that need to be addressed in the next 15 years as a result; Part 3 is concerned with HCI as a field of research and as a community of practitioners and designers; Part 4, recommendations, outlines specific suggestions for HCI in terms of how the field needs to be change. Therefore, the research report it talks about the future aspects and the future plans with an recommendations that has to be concern in an aspect of HCI, I have chosen to write about the part 4 where they give a good outline of the recommendations that has to be encounter for the new actions in the future of HCI.</p>
<p>The research report came with very good seventh future directions. Each direction will be described in an educationally signification for me, what I have learned and what should be the next future actions in consideration. Matter of course, no one will know in what kind of aspects and future plans the HCI will change, but still this research report gives vaulting and most important future recommendations that need to be considered, and there will be more and more recommendations and future directions as the technology and the HCI changes.</p>
<p>Before we start to talk about the recommendations in a field of HCI, let’s see what HCI is. It is a term used to refer to the understanding and designing of different relationships between people and computers. In the late 1970’s the main concern was usability. Since then, HCI has established and designed, developed and apply all manners to ensure that the technologies are easy to learn and easy to use. (Harper, Tom, Yvonne, &amp; Abigail, 2008, p. 84)</p>
<p>After getting familiar with the terms and the practice of HCI let as look though the main seventh future recommendations that were considered by the scholars and people involved in this forum.</p>
<ol>
<li>Recommendation 1: Revisit research and design methods in HCI: it is a distinct research area, methods and techniques have been used have altered over the years. Computer system and technologies are still in a way of changes, thus are the approaches for 2020 that needs to be considered:</li>
<li>Explore new ways of understanding users. Over the last decade there have been techniques and design-based practices involving cultural probes. Usage of existing techniques of understanding that have emerged from scientific and engineering traditions, designs, views of diverse disciplines and cultural traditions; usage of conceptual analysis in the first stage of new HCI, where can comes from techniques of analytic philosophy and clarifying the systems of meaning and value of actions that are involved.</li>
<li>Explore new ways of designing and making. Designing and making it takes a very important influence in a way of HCI. It is very important to comprehend for what, which and why the system is going to be used, what kind of users. In the future lightweight and prototypes should fit the designing and engineering solutions together. Should be developed new technological, prototype tool for the future development, and consider a test of hardware and software within every day.</li>
<li>Reconsider how to evaluate digital technologies. Create a purpose of usage of the system, towards the, is it going to be used in everyday life in houses, working spaces or other environment. For what kind of usability the system is going to be used. For all should be made evaluation tools to reconsider the criteria and techniques.</li>
<li>Recommendation 2: Be explicit about the remit of HCI. How far or whether the HCI as a research area should continue extend itself, or should be involved with interaction between people and digital technology, and should with concern itself more than in the past? Does are the question that should be raised. It should develop new design possibilities, future altering and crafting the landscape.</li>
<li>Recommendation 3: Develop disciplinary techniques that allow HCI to collaborate with other research communities</li>
<li>Disciplinary exchange. Requirement for HCI researchers to know how to converse with disciplines with very different traditions, they need to understand what philosophers can do and why philosophy is important. Example: economists.</li>
<li>Beyond interdisciplinary boundaries. HCI should ask what might be the appropriate models for allowing interdisciplinary investigations to happen and it is an area where investment in research theories and approaches, in the elements of HCI competence and skill, and in the foundations of the philosophy of science are required.</li>
<li>Recommendation 4: Teach HCI to the young. Children should be introduced to the ‘properties and possibilities of computing’ it is the only way that they develop sufficient understanding of computing to enable them to be fully computer-literate when they are adults, and help them to shape the world in relation to technology.</li>
<li>Recommendation 5: More advanced training for future HCI researchers. HCI professionals need to move outside of the scientific community they have lived within and find ways to engage with society as a whole.</li>
<li>Recommendation 6: Engage with government, policy and society. More better technical and economical approach, where there will be wide range of implementing HCI in a government, but in policy and society. HCI should have a strong links with the society, it needs to interact more, not only like for policy in a trust and security in computer systems.</li>
<li>Recommendation 7: Offer an inclusive future in 2020. By 2020, HCI will need to be able to design for and support differences in human value, irrespective of the economic means of those seeking those values. In this way, the future can be different and diverse because people want it to be. (Harper, Tom, Yvonne, &amp; Abigail, 2008, pp. 78-83)</li>
</ol>
<p>I found this article very interesting, not only in an aspect of human interaction with computers but with the actions that were taken and the propositions that were sum. I love to make a summer of the entire research paper, but because of the short time period I could not make it. Still I gained my knowledge what should be expected and where are burrows in HCI field. It gives me a perfect view for the future implementation of projects, aspects and techniques that can be used. Hope that this few years since the 2007, the implementation and recommendation directories have been successfully.</p>
