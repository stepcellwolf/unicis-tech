&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify possible infection of
malware into the wireshark capture file. The report should highlight the
following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download [not avaibale anymore]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find malware download in this pcap and extract malware or malwares
find out where malware was downloaded from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What malware …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify possible infection of
malware into the wireshark capture file. The report should highlight the
following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download [not avaibale anymore]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find malware download in this pcap and extract malware or malwares
find out where malware was downloaded from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What malware, malwares changes in system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&amp;amp;C Names and address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Document the process also where You found hints and how exactly You
did it (you need to show Your thought and communication process – please
write a summary of it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write an incident report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we have to consider the malware analysis report reminders,
please refer to [1] or [2]. Additional, analysis it is stated into the
Analysis section, where we explain the techniques, filter tools, gather
knowledge, links, etc. Structure of the laboratory report is first to
present analysis with details information. Malware and infections
description are described. Finally the conclusion made of all analysis
will be concise in summary section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;ANALYSIS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to open and use the above file, firstly we have to download
the wireshark tool. Where the main goal and purpose for wireshark
application is to analysis a network protocols from captured file.
Therefore please refer to the following link:
&lt;a href="http://www.wireshark.org/"&gt;http://www.wireshark.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Useful links for future use, please refer to [3, 4, 5 and 6]. On figure
1 it shows the Graphic Interface of Wireshark application with running
filter: http protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 1: Wireshark application, filter: http protocol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, from the figure 1 we can see that there is a lot of traffic
generated by the user. Therefore we have to apply and additional filter
rules, which will help and guide for better and easy analysis. As we go
through each generated http protocol traffic we can conclude that the
user generated and has been visiting different source, where can be
potential threat for the organization and personal use with a different
malicious code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to filter only the http protocols on port 80 with a header
GET, we should use the following filter: http.request.method == “GET”.
Where this filter will narrow down the results that are presented into
the captured file. In spite of the filter above it helps a lot, yet
there is still a lot of traffic generated, consequently we have to
utilize an additional filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another extremely useful wireshark option we used, was Analyze → Follow
TCP Stream which shows communication between IP addresses in more
readable and useful way: shows DNS name for the IP and if file was
downloaded gives filetype and name. We discovered that IP address
79.137.237.34 belongs to accord-component.ru. When we accessed the site
with various web browsers, all of them showed that it contained malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    GET /serial/index.php HTTP/1.1Accept: */*Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NETCLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0)Connection: Keep-AliveHost: accord-component.ruHTTP/1.1 200 OKServer: nginxDate: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 23:07:18GMTContent-Type: text/htmlTransfer-Encoding: chunkedConnection: keep-aliveX-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.2Content-Encoding: gzip&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another suspicious IP was 86.63.168.101, where from this IP address brought us to&lt;br&gt;domain name zumlelao.com, but it was un-accessible from browsers. Wireshark showed the User downloaded file 4.exe from zumlelao.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="brush: php"&gt;GET /load.php?file=0HTTP/1.1Accept: image/jpeg, application/x-ms-application, image/gif,application/xaml+xml, image/pjpeg, application/x-ms-xbap, */*Accept-Language: etUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NETCLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0)Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateHost: zumlelao.comConnection: Keep-AliveHTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 21:55:02GMTServer: Apache/2X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.17Cache-Control: publicContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=4.exeContent-Transfer-Encoding: binaryVary: Accept-EncodingContent-Encoding: gzipContent-Length: 10666Keep-Alive: timeout=1, max=100Connection: Keep-AliveContent-Type: application/octet-stream

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we can always use an Find function, which will help as to
identify certain traffic or site. Figure 2 demonstrated the usage of the
Find function, accessible from menu Edit -&gt; Find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 2: Wireshark, Find function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other IP addresses that were generated/extracted first the ones with
malware detected:
&lt;code&gt;79.137.237.34 -accord-component.ru; 86.63.168.101 zumlelao.com&lt;/code&gt;. Other
IP’s are:
&lt;code&gt;173.194.32.32 (33,34,41,50,51,52,58,59,60,63), 192.168.123.1, 193.184.164.159 (174,176,185), 193.40.252.83, 193.88.71.156, 194.126.108.69 (70), 194.126.124.136, 194.204.14.49, 195.222.15.74, 199.7.48.190, 209.85.173.95, 123.168.24.204 (209,221,225,229,235), 79.137.237.34, 80.252.91.41 (61), 69.171.228.11, 23.32.89.55, 23.32.99.172, 216.34.181.45 (48), 213.168.24.26, 90.190.148.34 (40), 86.63.168.101, 82.98.58.48, 81.19.238.61.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we run or analysis the above domain names into the google we will
automatic indicated that the zumlelao.com it is an before reported as a
malware site and the second too. Therefore the analysis and the
infection of details of malware are highlighted into the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;INFECTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the above captured file presents traffic generated by the user,
that can be threat for the organization, home user, etc. As from the
previous section demonstrates how to identify if the generated traffic
has infected or has the user visit the malicious code sites. This
section identifies the malicious code and displays their details.
Moreover, the zumlelao.com host it is reported previous as malicious
code site. For this purpose we gather the help from the following link:
&lt;a href="http://sopport.clean-mx.de/"&gt;http://sopport.clean-mx.de/&lt;/a&gt;. Here is the reported malicious,
suspicious code from the above host in the table bellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, figure 3 is proving the analysis made through the
wireshark, were one of the above links has been access, for more details
clink on the above link and points in a figure 3:A and B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 3: Prove of generating traffic of following malware link:

and the IP initiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to get the file itself for analysis, we used Netresec’s
Network Miner 2.1 http://www.netresec.com/?page=NetworkMiner. In Files
menu, it shows all packets as files.We uploaded 4.exe.octet-stream to
virustotal.com – 30 Antivirus software identified as malware Virustotal
link:
&lt;a href="http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=d6ee8736cd2eae8571b193b28b59dff33e9607237f78b0888d69c70f241bb04b-%201323098398"&gt;http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=d6ee8736cd2eae8571b193b28b59dff33e9607237f78b0888d69c70f241bb04b-1323098398&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trojan.Generic.KD malwares usually are classified as Backdoors. It
infects executable files in the system and its main goal is to make
backdoor into the system. It changes registry. In some cases it can put
payload on the infected system, slow it down and make internet browsing
difficult and time consuming. Aim of the malware can be stealing
information or gaining partial/full access of the victim’s system. On
the other hand, Trojan.Generic.KD malwares are difficult to remove from
infected computers. From VirusTotal analysis we can see that various
antivirus software can discover and identify Trojan.Generic.KD.438472.
Therefore one can remove malware by downloading antivirus software
provided by F-Secure, Comodo, Microsoft, Sophos, Symantec, DrWeb, etc.
Here is an example from Dr.Web how to delete Trojan.Generic.KD malware
&lt;a href="http://www.drwebhk.com/en/virus_removal/694829/Trojan.Generic.KD.53986.html"&gt;http://www.drwebhk.com/en/virus_removal/694829/Trojan.Generic.KD.53986.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our case we downloaded Dr.Web CureIt (free edition for home PCs,
which discovered the malware and removed it) –
&lt;a href="http://www.freedrweb.com/download+cureit/?nc=t&amp;amp;lng=en"&gt;http://www.freedrweb.com/download+cureit/?nc=t&amp;amp;lng=en&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before continuing to disinfect the system, please read and understand
the massage delivered through this forum:
&lt;a href="http://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=35407"&gt;http://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=35407&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays malicious codes, infection of the system is one of the highest
vector of production work everyday of the organizations. Therefore,
different approaches, advance analysis, troubleshooting, etc. has to be
applicable and stated in every organization. Leaking of data,
information, access of network (internal and external) can be very
harmful for organization and even the home usage of computers.
Therefore, this laboratory report main aim is to provide the reader to
be able to conduct advance analysis of system and their identification
of infection within the wireshark network analysis tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above sections in Analysis and in the Infection we have to
follow the steps and links that will help us for a further work.
Meanwhile, the captured generated traffic from the distributed file has
indeed indicated that the system it is infected. Were as an prove we
demonstrate an screen-shot, figure 3, that one of the infected link has
been visited. Likewise, the system of this user is infected. Thus
infection identified name is: TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen3, where we do supply
and the disinfecting stepwise solution with the above link. Closing, as
there are many different ways, tools, process for analysing the
malicious code behaviours in system this laboratory report is supplying
the reader with advance and stepwise solution for identifying the
infection of the system within advance network analysis wireshark
application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;WORKLOAD&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made analysis on the virtual Windows 7 machine. For virtualization we
used VirtualBox. During analysis each of group member did the same
analysis to cross - reference the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We basically used the following tools: Wireshark, Network Miner and
&lt;a href="http://virustotal.com/"&gt;virustotal.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to create a solution
and instructions for testing an IDS^1^ systems usefulness for detecting

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to create a solution
and instructions for testing an IDS^1^ systems usefulness for detecting
attacks against a wordpress site. In addition, we have to
develop/download/find/whatever a SNORT configuration (rulesets,
preprocessors, whatever) that performs better than the default
configuration in previous post. By better we mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less false positives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less false negatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The objectives are contradictory so the rule of thumb is one false
    negative per 10 false positives eg. solution with 10 false positives
    and 2 false negatives is better than the solution with 100 false
    positives and 1 false negatives, but the solution with 10 false
    positives and 1 false negative is better than the solution with 1
    false positive and 2 false negatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attack is defined by a single invocation of all the test scripts in
    a row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the new rules have to be able to detect not only the default
attacks that are set to a default snort configuration, yet they have to
be able to detect SQL injection, brute force password, apache killer
script, pytbull, etc. Furthermore, in figure 1 we are illustrating the
scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 1: Illustration of Scenario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the proposal section we will present two proposals that
have been submitted due to this laboratory test and additionally in
result section we will highlighted the identification numbers made by
snort set new rules. In section appendixes we will provide you with more
details configuration procedures, configuration of VM’s – Virtual
Machines, attacks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, closing with an conclusion and the results of best set of rules
made of the proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SETUP of SNORT&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To setup snort in a right way, that will work for the second Host only
network please following the instruction link provided with a full
description and configuration of snort [SNORT2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;PROPOSALS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total two proposals are presented in next sub-sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;a href="http://www.tud.ttu.ee/~t061780/attacks/robert.rules"&gt;http://www.tud.ttu.ee/~t061780/attacks/robert.rules&lt;/a&gt; to your Snort.
On your Snort machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    cd /etc/snort/ruleswget http://www.tud.ttu.ee/~t061780/attacks/robert.rules

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have the rules, add them to your snort conf file (default
/etc/snort/snort.conf). To do that inser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;include $RULE_PATH/robert.rules&lt;/code&gt; somewhere with rest of the rules after
line 800. Run Snort and test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the following rules: &lt;a href="http://predragtasevski.com/src/predrag.rules"&gt;http://predragtasevski.com/src/predrag.rules&lt;/a&gt;.
To be able to insert the snort rules in to the snort file please double
check where it is located. You can find the location with the following
command: find / -name snort.conf Before you continue please change the
IP address to your server address on line number #6, example alert tcp
any any -&gt; 192.168.56.X where x is your octet. Then to add the
following rules at the conf file do the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat predrag.rules &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; snort.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is time to start or restart snort. It should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After executing the above proposal we will highlight the results into
the table bellow. Result are presented from the total amount of reports,
registered alerts in the snort. This is done by help of web interface of

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 3: Total number of Unique Alerts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above results we came to conclusion that the new applied rules
were successful and were able to recognize alerts more then the default
rule set of Snort. Meanwhile, only proposal 2 was able to recognized an
SQL injections without any additional tweaking. Although proposal 1 was
still useful, on the other hand the best solution is when we combine the
both rule sets proposals. Then the Snort is able to recognized an
significant number of total alerts and additionally for our laboratory
report more interesting is unique total number alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closing, even the default Snort rules configuration is good, yet when
you tweak it by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your own needs, you will have much better IDS system for your network.
In future it should be recommended always refer to [snort_rules], to
gather more available advance Snort rules, made by experts. Where will
help you to configure and setup Snort IDS system to detecting attacks
against a wordpress site, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we test typical SQL- injection in URLs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commands used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    wget "http://192.168.56.101/?p=1'%20OR%20'1'='1"wget "http://192.168.56.101/?p=1'%20AND%201=(SELECT%20COUNT(*)%20FROM%20tabname);%20—"

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snort by default does not detect this, where in applying the proposal 2
rules, it did detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIX 5&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test Snort and acidbase, perform a portscan of the Snort host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo nmap -p1-65535 -sV -sS -O 192.168.56.102&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIX 6&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To setup pytbull it is a bit of pain, yet if you follow the rules and
the documentation it will work like shark. For documentation please

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to create a solution

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to create a solution
and instructions for testing an IDS\^1 systems usefulness for detecting
attacks against a wordpress site. In addition, a repeatable process to
evaluate vendor claims. Whatever passive IDS system sample delivered as
a VM or a dedicated box. Creating the IDS system itself is out of scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process must be detailed enough so that somebody else can get the
same results when applying that. The “other person” is expected to have
IT knowledge sufficient to install and run a Linux desktop. Budget
requirements: Modest – 2 machines + a tester (Joe) + networking
equipment to connect the two machines and an IDS together. The process
must test at least the following attacks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Port scan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SYN flood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Regular” DoS overwhelming attack (Ab)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optionally the process may test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;slowloris/pyloris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache Range header DoS vulnerability
&lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org/security/CVE-011-3192.txt"&gt;http://httpd.apache.org/security/CVE-011-3192.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attack targeting any other fairly recent (not older than 3-4 years)
known vulnerability that could in theory apply to the target system
(wordpress server)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the competition rules are: The highest number of attacks
evaluated. Limits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each attack must be relevant eg. if it attacks IIS it’s NOT relevant.
If it attacks Windows RPC it’s not relevant. If it attacks some other
CMS eg. Drupal it’s NOT relevant. * Basically equivalent attacks count
as one (different port scanners for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must be able to explain in broad terms what the attack does eg:
attacks the vulnerability #X in Apache server If the #attacks is
equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lab instaractions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install 3 VM-s: Attacker IDS and Target&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
​1. Make sure all VM-s have two network adapters: NAT and Host-Only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Install Snort and it’s GUI called “acidbase” on IDS
&lt;a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SnortIDS"&gt;https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SnortIDS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. Install Apache, Mysql and WordPress on Target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​4. Execute an attack on Attacker towards the IP address on the Host
Only network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​5. Take notice of the results displayed on Acid console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​6. Reset counters, move on to next attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, illustration 1 describes the overview of above scenario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 1: Lab 5 Illustration of Scenario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, setup procedure of snort, secondly available proposals and
thirdly illustrating the results and the functionality of proposals.
Finally, closing this laboratory report with conclusion. In addition,
appendixes is configuration of VM’s – Virtual Machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SETUP of SNORT&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To setup snort in a right way, that will work for the second Host only
network please following the instruction link provided with a full
description and configuration of snort [SNORT2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the setup and configuration to run snort on the second
interface use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;snort -c /etc/snort/snort/conf -i eth1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;PROPOSALS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total three proposals and each one is highlighted in the next
sub-sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Set up IDS (Snort) and WordPress on the first PC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Install Ubuntu server on the second PC . Then install all attacking
tools there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```wget enos.itcollege.ee/\~avein/lab4i.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sudo sh lab4i.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    After that you should have:- ```ab.sh``` – DoS attack script – uses ab to generate traffic flood- ```apachekiller.pl``` – Apachekiller attack script More info: http://www.hackersgarage.com/apache-killer-denial-of-service-flaw-in-apache-webserver.html- ```README.txt``` – extra instructions- ```scan.sh``` - Port scanning script - uses nmap- ```sloworis.pl``` - Sloworis attack script More info: http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/- ```synf.sh``` - syn flood attack script - uses hping33. Start your IDS/wordpress server and the server with attack tools. 4. Run each attack tool ONE AT A TIME (targeting the wordpress/IDS server of course) . Monitor the logs/notifications on yours IDS system (SNORT) and check whether wordpress site is still accessible. Let each attack tool run 2 minutes, then stop the attack by pressing CTRL+C on the terminal window where the attack tool is running. The only exeption is port scan- its better to wait until it finishes. After each attack save the IDS log and wait atlest 5 minutes before trying next tool (to give server time to recover). Best practice is to manually check if the server load is at normal (one can use htop for that).a) To run DoS attack:```sh ab.sh {target} eg sh ab.sh 192.168.56.101```b) For port scan:```sh scan.sh {target IP} eg sh scan.sh 192.168.56.101```c) For Syn flood (with hping3)```sh synf.sh {target} eg synf.sh 192.168.56.101/wordpress```d) For Sloworis attack:```perl slowloris.pl -dns {target} eg perl sloworis.pl -dns 192.168.56.101/wordpress```e) For Apachekiller attack:```perl apachekiller.pl {target IP} eg perl apachekiller.pl 192.168.56.101```## PROPOSAL 2### IntroFor this scenario we need to run several different attacks and scans to be able to compare the results with different IDS setups and rulesets. We might also want to test it with legitimate traffic to see that we dont get false positives in our alarms. We dont have that much legitimate traffic possibilities with 1 blog on our servers right now, but if we start tweaking the IDS false positives becomes an important metric and we might want to test normal usage and create traffic to run with tcpreplay for example. My proposal is to test the IDS with pytbull running on BackTrack. Pytbull is IDS testing framework and BackTrack a Linux ditribution. I will assume that we have WordPress server with running default Snort set up on it and working. No extensive testing has been done with different snort setups so we might have to tune the methods, but basic things should be covered.### DL and install BackTrack- &lt;a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/downloads/" target="_blank"&gt;backtrack-linux.org/downloads/&lt;/a&gt;Install it rather than running a live version for this scenario. Boot it up in default mode, start GUI and launch installation from desktop. Default login root / toor. Standard setup comes with pytbull and several pieces of software the IDS test-system depends on like nmap, hping3, nikto and others.### Setup connectionsConnect the machines and install ftp and ssh on server. We need ftp to get snort alert files and ssh to run attacks against.```apt-get install vsftpd openssh-server```### Setup pytbullYou will find pytbull from ```/pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/``` or Applications -&gt; BackTrack -&gt; Information Gathering -&gt; Network Analysis -&gt; IDS IPS Identification -&gt; pytbull when using the GUI. Change the configuration file values to have correct connection information, user credentials and locations of dependencies. Here you also select which test modules out of the 9 available you want to run. ClientSideAttacks needs extra configuration.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cd /pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gedit config.cfg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example conf file: http://www.tud.ttu.ee/\~t061780/attacks/config.cfg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now get custom DoS module to have hping SYN flood and ApacheBench DoS
tests covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cd modules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mv denialOfService.py denialOfService.py-backup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wget http://www.tud.ttu.ee/\~t061780/attacks/denialOfService.py&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to refer to Pytbull documentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    ### Run```/pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/pytbull -t WP/Snort server IP;```If everything works you will find html report file under /reports. If you have problems add -d on run for debugging.###(optional) SlowlorisTo have slowloris attack test for pytbull we need to get custom slowloris that allows to set how many packets to send because we dont want the tests to run forever. I added argument s that tells the script to stop after we have sent s packets.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cd /pentest/stressing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wget www.tud.ttu.ee/\~t061780/attacks/slowloris.pl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowloris attack has been written into DoS module, you have to uncomment
it. Lines 47-52.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gedit /pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/modules/denialOfService.py&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    ## PROPOSAL 3For this proposal I will suggest to use open source tool OpenVas for vulnerability scanning, to test our IDS system. It contains many security tools integrated. The security and analysis tools are: Nikto, nmap, ike-scan, snmpwalk, amap, ldapsearch, SLAD (John-the-Ripper, Chkrootkit, LSOF, ClamAV, Tripwire, TIGER, logwatch, trapwatch, lm-sensors, snort and ovaldi), pnscan, portbunny, strobe, w3af, etc.Instructions of installation process, for further more information please refer to &lt;a href="http://www.openvas.org/setup-and-start.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.openvas.org/setup-and-start.html&lt;/a&gt;### Step 1: Configure OBS Repository```sudo apt-get -y install python-software-propertiessudo add-apt-repository "deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:/OpenVAS:STABLE:/v4/xUbuntu_10.04/./"sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys BED1E87979EAFD54 sudo apt-get update

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Quick-Install OpenVAS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    sudo apt-get -y install greenbone-security-assistant gsd openvas-cli openvas-manager openvas-scanner openvas-administrator sqlite3 xsltproc

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Quick-Start OpenVAS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(copy and paste whole block, during first time you will be asked to set
a password for user “admin”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    test -e /var/lib/openvas/CA/cacert.pem || sudo openvas-mkcert -qsudo openvas-nvt-sync test -e /var/lib/openvas/users/om || sudo openvas-mkcert-client -n om -i sudo /etc/init.d/openvas-manager stopsudo /etc/init.d/openvas-scanner stopsudo openvassdsudo openvasmd --migratesudo openvasmd --rebuildsudo killall openvassdsleep 15sudo /etc/init.d/openvas-scanner startsudo /etc/init.d/openvas-manager startsudo /etc/init.d/openvas-administrator restartsudo /etc/init.d/greenbone-security-assistant restarttest -e /var/lib/openvas/users/admin || sudo openvasad -c add_user -n admin -r Admin

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 4: Log into OpenVAS as “admin”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;https://localhost:9392/&lt;/code&gt; or start &lt;code&gt;“gsd”&lt;/code&gt; on a command line as a
regular user (not as root!). Optional we can use and the Slowloris and
Pyloris DoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download link for Slowloris is:
&lt;a href="http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/slowloris.pl"&gt;http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/slowloris.pl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above solution and tool will help us to check and test our IDS
system usefulness. It tests the following attacks: Port scan, SYN flood,
DoS, etc. The results are presented with nice GUI interface. For more
info about the project please refer to
&lt;a href="http://www.openvas.org/"&gt;www.openvas.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After executing the above proposal we will highlight the results.
Nevertheless, only the Proposal 1 was able to run the test. Others two,
Proposal 2 and Proposal 3 were unsuccessful of installation process and
configuration and to run the attacks. Moreover, the result are presented
from the total amount of reports, registered alerts in the snort. This
is done by help of web interface of Basic Analysis and Security Engine
in addition Analysis Console for Intrusion Databases (ACID) project tool
[ACID]. Therefore, the result from the Proposal 1 and from the rest are
highlighted below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proposal 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DoS – registered alerts: 2;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port scan : 8;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;synf.sh: 1344;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slowloris.pl: 1782;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;apachekiller.pl: not working;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposal 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pytbull: 0, the message was: Error: FTP error, 550 failed to open
file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposal 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   Too complicated to be configured and installed. The instructions and
the procedures should be more easy. After few hours of configuring
and test, tweaks are is still not working. Yet there are many good
tutorials how to configure OpenVAS please refer [OpenVas1] and
[OpenVas2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primarily, setting-up IDS, the Snort, it is not an easy task to
complete. On the other hand, configuring, installing, etc. the testing
tools for IDS system is even more complicated. Therefore, the Proposal 1
has the best solution and installation process of the test tools.
Despite, that it was the only one that worked. Finally, recommendation
for the IDS solutions and in addition to the penetrating tools to test
the usefulness of IDS has to be more simple and stepwise solution.
However, the above scenario and proposals are great tools and solutions
for a future reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the present we must first understand the past. The
Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like
nothing before. The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and
computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration of
capabilities. The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting
capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for
collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers
without regard for geographic location.&lt;span id="more-113"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the
benefits of sustained investment and commitment to research and
development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early
research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia have
been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology
(Barry M. , et al., 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the
initial prototype of what is often called the National (or Global or
Galactic) Information Infrastructure. Its history is complex and
involves many aspects – technological, organizational, and community.
And its influence reaches not only to the technical fields of computer
communications but throughout society as we move toward increasing use
of online tools to accomplish electronic commerce, information
acquisition, and community operations(Barry M. , et al., 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likelihood, computers have changed the face of communication to an
extent that we can’t consider our routine life without presence of these
machines. With the availability of technologies like internet, instant
messaging, emailing and others, the computers has fast replaced
conventional means of communicating with each other(Communication Type,
2008).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one writes letter anymore. It’s been said that longhand or cursive is
no longer taught in grade school. No need for it. People don’t write
anymore. As technology defined the late Twentieth Century, we became
both closer together and further apart. People had more time for an
online chat via the fast growing Internet than they did for a day at the
park with a dear friend. That was bad. On the other hand, we connected
to people all over the world that we might not otherwise get to enjoy.
Today, computer technology constantly changes the way we communicate
(Friends of Time, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look through the history of computer communication from 1968 to
nowadays there are three unique market sectors: Data Communication,
Networking and Internet (Internetworking). Data communication is an
electronic transmission of information that has been encoded digitally
(as for storage and processing by computers). Computer Networking is an
interconnection of various computer systems located at different places.
In computer network two or more computers are linked together with a
medium and data communication devices for the purpose of communicating
data and sharing resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Internet is a network of networks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millions of computers all over the world are connected through the
Internet. Computer users on the Internet can contact one another
anywhere in the world. If your computer is connected to the Internet,
you can connect to millions of computers. You can gather information and
distribute your data. It is very much similar to the telephone
connection where you can talk with any person anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As digital media takes flight, the grand slam of computer communication
has arrived. Skype . It’s free, it’s live, and it’s real face time. Not
only can people talk, but they can see each other as they talk. There
are even Skype and “skype-like” apps for Smartphones. To an extent,
communication has a more human feel again. People can see friends and
family a world away and keep very close contact. And leave it to
teenagers to figure out how to make Skype the new bedroom powwow.
Teenagers simply turn it on and hang out. They may not even be talking
to each other, but they know the other person is there (Friends of Time,
2011). With a free access of the Internet though the wireless local area
network (WLAN 1) we can chat and talk with anyone from anywhere, without
the consideration of graphical location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet and computers are offering a wide range of communication
influence. We can communicate to text messages to your friends through
computers and communication tools provided by it. From emails and
newsletters to text chats and instant messaging, micro-blogging,
computers can help you to reach your friends, relatives, business
associates and others in the matter of few seconds. Communication tools
to communicate your voice messages without facing the geographical
restrictions. Voice mails and voice chats, brought revolutionary changes
how have computers changed the way we communicate. Business
communication with the help of audio and video conferencing. The
executives of different branches of a company, located in different
geographical locations, can communicate with each other and distances
can pose no hurdles in establishing these communication systems. Other
influence of computer communication are helping and proving the
education system of offering a distant learning, gaining a degree
without being at the university location, etc. One of the popular
concepts in nowadays communication is online social networking, instance
of communication, joining different online clubs and communicates with
individuals from various parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, imagine a day without computer in your room or on the
office desk. For instance no emails, no chatting, no instant messaging
and no web camera interactions, how we are going to feel? Therefore, we
all can understand how computers have changed the way we communicate.
Life can come to a standstill without computers and similar devices
around us. Consequently, communication through computers is an important
aspect of every individual today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of communicating through computer and Internet is that you
can practice it from any part of the world. All computer technology is
wonderful and the more access to communication the better. But it will
be a shame if the world becomes so shrouded in technology that good old
fashioned face to face people skills become a rare art instead of an
everyday norm.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, all the above describes how the computers changed the way we
communicate. This is because computers have become great contributors
towards the world of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

What are the most significant changes? What has remained unchanged?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start the discussion about the major changes in warfare from
antiquity to present day we will precede with definition of War and its

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start the discussion about the major changes in warfare from
antiquity to present day we will precede with definition of War and its
significant and remained unchanged changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WAR in its literal meaning is fighting, for fighting alone is the
efficient principle in the manifold activity which, in a wide sense, is
called war. But fighting is a trial of strength of the moral and
physical forces by means of the latter. That the moral cannot be omitted
is evident of itself, for the condition of the mind has always the most
decisive influence on the forces employed in war (Graham, 2002).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanity has wedged war since antiquity through nowadays for million
causes, national and religious freedom, hatred, grudge, human rights,
liberating the enslaved etc. But one principle in war has always been
present from the depths of history till today, that is, wars are fought
for one purpose only, conquest of new territory from which economic
benefit is to be acquired for the soul use of the conqueror. Nowhere is
this more obvious than in the armed clashes of the beginning of the XXI
century, when under the pretext of human rights countries are being
robed from their natural resources and air-raids are killing those whom
should protect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we met with the theory of war and moral principles, it is time to
consider changes that have occurred between the ancient and modern
times. The military of ancient Egypt had introduced the new technologies
of metal, where they used bronze in the Middle Kingdom as main weapons
source, after it changed to iron in the New Kingdom and all during the
Late Dynastic Period. The Old Kingdom soldiers were equipped with a
great variety of weapons: shields, spears, cudgels, maces, daggers, bows
and arrows. The New Kingdom carried spears, battle axes, sickleswords
(MdC transliteration: xpS – khepesh or khopesh) and daggers. After the
bowmen, either on foot or on chariots, had softened up the enemy forces
with a shower of arrows (Dollinger, Dynasties XVIII to XX, 2004), the
infantry would rush in, breaking their ranks with hand weapons, maces
with wooden handles and stone – later metal – heads, battle axes,
hatchets, clubs, swords, sickleswords and daggers (Dollinger, Weapons,
2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persian Army had only three wars, started from 490 BC until 478BC, the
army was very multicultural, were organizes in a decimal basis,
regiments, units and corps were grouped in tens, hundreds and thousands
(Drury, 2006). Officers were being responsible for ten men, another for
one hundred, one thousand and ten thousand. Heavily equipped with
weapons, which are: Thrusting Spear, palta, Akinakes , Xiphos, kopis,
bow etc (Wildfiregames, 2004).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greece war, first nine years of the war consisted of both war in Troy
and war against the neighbouring regions, where destroyed Trojan
economy, allowed Greeks to getter a large amount of resources. The
Greeks won most of the battles, but they still could not break the walls
of Troy. The weapons that were used in those battles were bows and
arrows. As for strategies the famous Trojan horse, when Odysseus had a
perfect idea to build a big wooden horse where inside will be field with
the soldiers, which bring and invasion of Troy from the Greeks (Rita,
2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Army of Macedonia was the army of ancient Kingdom of Macedonia. It
considers a grate military force where there were reforms constructed
from the suggestion of King Philip II of Macedon and then his son
Alexander the Great. The introduction was in innovation of weapons and
new tactics, along with unique elements combination of military
elements, which bring a great intercontinental empire (Ellis, 1979).
Philip II had implemented in Macedonian phalanx army separation which
one group were on a mission to conquer a city and the other to conquer
castles. Each phalangite carried as his primary weapon a sarissa, but
the phalangite were not the focal point for the battle, they have used
other forces like: skirmishers, range troops, reserves of allied
hoplites, and artillery (Hellenica, 2005).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rome in the wars had adapted weapons, armour and tactics of many enemies
they fought. Main weapons of Rome soldiers were Spanish sword – gladius,
it had two throwing spears, a large shield, body armour and a helmet.
They have also operated with the fire supported weapons, scorpios,
carroballistas, onagers. For a fest moves they started to build bridges,
so that the soldiers and the army can move faster. The army can march up
to 30 km a day. They were very evil, trained to stab a 5 cm deep wound,
after breaking the enemy, Romans tended to kill as many enemies as
possible and their cavalry pursued fleeing enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Rome the medieval Europe warfare followed, which was the war
of legal and acceptable justification, nobility (knights) and the main
force on the battlefield was a heavy cavalry, where the law of the armed
conflict was born. The second largest empire in human history was the
Mongol empire. Mongols army had the capacity to move up to 150 km a day.
The weapons of the army consisted of massive fire (bow) speed and
manoeuvres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wars of the XVI Century were mostly protracted and indecisive. There was
insistency on building a fortress that was very difficult to conquer.
The most important improvement is the side of the weapons with adoption
of light guns and gunpowder. Gustavus Adolphus had guns in his army, he
had 1 gun per 83, but his enemies had 1 gun per 2000 men. The main thing
was to build and modify the fortresses for safety and hard to conquer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World War I, sometimes described as ‘the war to end all wars’ (Creveld,
2000, p. 162), the strategies were based on first manoeuvre, and then
attrition. Forces and armaments were infantry, cavalry artillery, and
surface navy (initially); later – tanks, planes, submarines, chemical
weapons. The tactics were manoeuvre, frontal assaults, fortified
defence, artillery concentration (initially); the theoretical thinking:
seeking the way out of dead end, but not finding the means and ways. The
first known bombardment from the sky, using airplanes was by Bulgarian
army on the 16 of October 1912 at battle of Adrianople, where they were
captivated by the Turkish army. From the German newspaper “Geschichte
des Luftkriegs”, Militarverlag der DDR, Berlin, 1975, though the 1912
United Kingdom had 23 air planes, Russian – 99, German – 46, Italian –
22, Japan – 10 and USA – 3 air planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second World War, where the technology and the concept of the war were
getting bigger, developed into a prolonged and extremely deadly struggle
of attrition. The Germans invented the rockets (vau1 and vau2).
Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the first and only events of deployments of
nuclear weapons in the world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second half of the 20th century, after the valuable technical point, the
arms forward for an outbreak of terrorism. That means that wars are no
longer big and global; the enemy is no longer in uniforman in force. And
size is no longer as great as it was the enemy can attack from anywhere.
Therefore, no longer wars head-do met the two armies, but running by
partisan / guerillas. Terrorism is an unconventional war de facto, i.e.
anti-insurgent operation, i.e. counter insurgency. Which create the kind
of combat actions that are performed nowadays in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In the 20th century, has one goal, redistribution of resources, i.e. to
get to justify the need to test before the war for democracy and human
rights. Macedonia is the country that is inclined towards terrorism, the
early 20th century, April 28 1903rd in Thessaloniki, the boatmen of
Thessaloniki have committed terrorist actions against the capital of
Western Europe and Turkey, i.e. have planted bombs in the Ottoman Bank
in Thessaloniki, the main post office, and planted a bomb in a ship
(Sotros, 2004 December).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As can read above the changes are very drastic. Humanity is fighting for
the different purpose; starting from the antiquity to nowadays, not only
in weapons that were used and presented, but in the strategies in a
tactics and theoretical thinking. Therefore, there are no more battles
wars, people are grouping and they can embattle from anywhere, which
gives a content of the terroristic activities of the wars. Today the
humanity and the scholars should getter together to work around of the
problems and solutions for the future, possibilities of internet (social
networks, VOIP, IM etc.), net generations1, thus today it is the main
source of grouping the population for massive protests or any other
actions, which can end-up to a war or scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently the technology and science are rising, the possibilities
and the changes in an aspect of wars will change. For instant is Russian
– Georgian conflict in 2008 as a result of territorial attack and in
sequence with it there was an cyber-attack in progress2; or powerful
internet worm repeatedly targeted five nuclear industrial facilities in
Iran and many others3. Therefore, nowadays this actions and concept of
warfare is different, no more uniforms, battles etc. Warfare’s are
getting new aspect and new ways to approach through the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

the El Bulli Hacienda Hotel near Seville, Spain. The event’s title
expressed its key question: what will Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
be like in the year 2020? (Harper, Tom, Yvonne, &amp;amp; Abigail, 2008, p. 8)
The report that I have read it is divided in a four parts; Part 1 it is
look back over the past 20 years or so; Part 2 it gives an outline how
does changes are transforming the nature of our interaction with
computers and the key questions that need to be addressed in the next 15
years as a result; Part 3 is concerned with HCI as a field of research
and as a community of practitioners and designers; Part 4,
recommendations, outlines specific suggestions for HCI in terms of how
the field needs to be change. Therefore, the research report it talks
about the future aspects and the future plans with an recommendations
that has to be concern in an aspect of HCI, I have chosen to write about
the part 4 where they give a good outline of the recommendations that
has to be encounter for the new actions in the future of HCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research report came with very good seventh future directions. Each
direction will be described in an educationally signification for me,
what I have learned and what should be the next future actions in
consideration. Matter of course, no one will know in what kind of
aspects and future plans the HCI will change, but still this research
report gives vaulting and most important future recommendations that
need to be considered, and there will be more and more recommendations
and future directions as the technology and the HCI changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start to talk about the recommendations in a field of HCI,
let’s see what HCI is. It is a term used to refer to the understanding
and designing of different relationships between people and computers.
In the late 1970’s the main concern was usability. Since then, HCI has
established and designed, developed and apply all manners to ensure that
the technologies are easy to learn and easy to use. (Harper, Tom,
Yvonne, &amp;amp; Abigail, 2008, p. 84)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting familiar with the terms and the practice of HCI let as
look though the main seventh future recommendations that were considered
by the scholars and people involved in this forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 1: Revisit research and design methods in HCI: it is
    a distinct research area, methods and techniques have been used have
    altered over the years. Computer system and technologies are still
    in a way of changes, thus are the approaches for 2020 that needs to
    be considered:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore new ways of understanding users. Over the last decade there
    have been techniques and design-based practices involving cultural
    probes. Usage of existing techniques of understanding that have
    emerged from scientific and engineering traditions, designs, views
    of diverse disciplines and cultural traditions; usage of conceptual
    analysis in the first stage of new HCI, where can comes from
    techniques of analytic philosophy and clarifying the systems of
    meaning and value of actions that are involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore new ways of designing and making. Designing and making it
    takes a very important influence in a way of HCI. It is very
    important to comprehend for what, which and why the system is going
    to be used, what kind of users. In the future lightweight and
    prototypes should fit the designing and engineering solutions
    together. Should be developed new technological, prototype tool for
    the future development, and consider a test of hardware and software
    within every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reconsider how to evaluate digital technologies. Create a purpose of
    usage of the system, towards the, is it going to be used in everyday
    life in houses, working spaces or other environment. For what kind
    of usability the system is going to be used. For all should be made
    evaluation tools to reconsider the criteria and techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 2: Be explicit about the remit of HCI. How far or
    whether the HCI as a research area should continue extend itself, or
    should be involved with interaction between people and digital
    technology, and should with concern itself more than in the past?
    Does are the question that should be raised. It should develop new
    design possibilities, future altering and crafting the landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 3: Develop disciplinary techniques that allow HCI to
    collaborate with other research communities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disciplinary exchange. Requirement for HCI researchers to know how
    to converse with disciplines with very different traditions, they
    need to understand what philosophers can do and why philosophy is
    important. Example: economists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beyond interdisciplinary boundaries. HCI should ask what might be
    the appropriate models for allowing interdisciplinary investigations
    to happen and it is an area where investment in research theories
    and approaches, in the elements of HCI competence and skill, and in
    the foundations of the philosophy of science are required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 4: Teach HCI to the young. Children should be
    introduced to the ‘properties and possibilities of computing’ it is
    the only way that they develop sufficient understanding of computing
    to enable them to be fully computer-literate when they are adults,
    and help them to shape the world in relation to technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 5: More advanced training for future HCI researchers.
    HCI professionals need to move outside of the scientific community
    they have lived within and find ways to engage with society as a
    whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 6: Engage with government, policy and society. More
    better technical and economical approach, where there will be wide
    range of implementing HCI in a government, but in policy and
    society. HCI should have a strong links with the society, it needs
    to interact more, not only like for policy in a trust and security
    in computer systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 7: Offer an inclusive future in 2020. By 2020, HCI
    will need to be able to design for and support differences in human
    value, irrespective of the economic means of those seeking those
    values. In this way, the future can be different and diverse because
    people want it to be. (Harper, Tom, Yvonne, &amp;amp; Abigail, 2008, pp.
    78-83)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this article very interesting, not only in an aspect of human
interaction with computers but with the actions that were taken and the
propositions that were sum. I love to make a summer of the entire
research paper, but because of the short time period I could not make
it. Still I gained my knowledge what should be expected and where are
burrows in HCI field. It gives me a perfect view for the future
implementation of projects, aspects and techniques that can be used.
Hope that this few years since the 2007, the implementation and
recommendation directories have been successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
