&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify three analyses of
malware files from the archive file send by the lecture. The archive
contains 89 malware files. The way how we choice 3 files is by following
algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soft them by name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First use last number of your …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;PURPOSE&lt;/h1&gt;

contains 89 malware files. The way how we choice 3 files is by following
algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soft them by name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First use last number of your student code + your birthday day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, generate random number from &lt;a href="http://www.random.org/"&gt;http://www.random.org/&lt;/a&gt; and
    only if it does not match first number use it for choosing the file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, use random number generator again and if it does not match
    first or second number use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malware archive can be download from the following link: [unfortunatly
not available anymore]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WARNING FILE CONTAINS LIVE VIRUSES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Task that need to be complete for this laboratory assignment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick your malware&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run your malware against 2 of next online analysis tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find additional 2 online analysis tools where to analyse virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that should be presented in the laboratory report are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chosen numbers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General information about malware&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;md5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;link to analysis result if it is possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;link to disinfecting instructions – if not possible explanation why it
is not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis tools – links&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your opinion about each analysis tool and comparison results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we are going to analyse the chosen files in section Chosen
files and each file with the above required information and detail
analysis results, links to disinfecting instructions, analysis tools
used for this purpose. Secondary, expression about each analysis tool
used and comparison results will be presented in section Analysis. In
addition, in section Appendixes its provides what virtual environment
has been used for this laboratory report. Because we know that if we
open this file in our real machine we will get infected. That is why we
are using an Linux virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, each file will be analysed with two different tools, in
case to gather more information and solution for disinfecting process.
Finally the conclusion made of all collected data will be concise in
conclusion section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CHOSEN FILES&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of files are listed bellow and the name of the file that is going
to be analysed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Number: 71; File name: &lt;code&gt;sales.exe; Size: 454.7 KB&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Number: 57; File name: &lt;code&gt;mgre.exe; Size: 61.4 KB&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. Number: 60; File name: &lt;code&gt;moos3.ee; Size: 91.6 KB&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;FILE 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;File name: &lt;code&gt;sales.exe; Size: 454.7 KB;&lt;/code&gt; Number: 71.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above malware file has been reported that is capable to send out
e-mail message with the built in SMTP client engine. Second, it contains
characteristics of Waledac, a worm that spreads by sending an e-mail
containing links to copies of itself. And finally, creates a startup
registry entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links provided, are demonstrating which anti virus software/application
can disinfected the malware infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools for analysing the malware are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Netscty – Online Sandbox: &lt;a href="http://netscty.com/malware-tool"&gt;http://netscty.com/malware-tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Virustotal.com – &lt;a href="http://www.virustotal.com/index.html"&gt;http://www.virustotal.com/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;FILE 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;File name: &lt;code&gt;mgre.exe; Size: 61.4 KB;&lt;/code&gt; Number: 57.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    MD5: 1375a8e437db6acafe2b0419cfbff7ecSHA1:b48f702a5a0fa8558c278dd97ecfbd0d637fefd3SHA256: 89294d70e80547aac5b506915d2e8fc0309c0e578ab16fc9875c9a4668e63709

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to analyse report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1.
&lt;a href="http://camas.comodo.com/cgi-bin/submit?%20file=89294d70e80547aac5b506915d2e8fc0309c0e578ab16fc9875c9a4668e63709"&gt;http://camas.comodo.com/cgi-bin/submit?file=89294d70e80547aac5b506915d2e8fc0309c0e578ab16fc9875c9a4668e63709&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From above analysed links we can conclude that the file creates keys, it
changes values in registry, it change only one file, creates process
called sample.exe and adds value to the modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The links do not show any way of disinfecting the following malware
file. My personal opinion of the above links is good that they can show
you that this file is malware, but still they do not show you enough
information. Which can help you for further instructions and actions
that should be consider. Not even providing you an information or links
which anti virus software can help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools for analysing the malware are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comodo Instant Malware Analysis – &lt;a href="http://camas.comodo.com/"&gt;http://camas.comodo.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;FILE 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;File name: &lt;code&gt;moos3.exe; Size: 91.6 KB;&lt;/code&gt; Number: 60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to analyse report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The malware file, contains characteristics of an identified security
risk. Possible security risk is Backdoor.Agent.AJU [Backdoor.Agent.AJU].
The threat category is network-aware worm and malicious trojan horse.
Its modifying file system, memory and registry. The origin of this
malware indicates possible country, Russian Federation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the reports we can conclude that most of the known anti virus
software has hit of this malware infection and it can disinfected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools for analysing the malware are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Anubis: Analyzing Unknown Binaries – &lt;a href="http://anubis.iseclab.org/"&gt;http://anubis.iseclab.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. ThreatExpert – &lt;a href="http://www.threatexpert.com/"&gt;http://www.threatexpert.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;ANALYSIS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web tool that we have used to analysis three of random chosen files
are listed bellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we will compare each one of those service, what kind of
information they show, provide and do they supply with disinfected
solution, if so how, and why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netscty – Online Sandbox: &lt;a href="http://netscty.com/malware-tool"&gt;http://netscty.com/malware-tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compare our results from the above list of online analysing tools I
have setup an score from 1 to 5 of each section. Where the highest score
is better solution. With the following attributes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above table give as an perfect over view, which tool is easy to use,
provides enough information, disinfected information and gain the
highest mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to generalize that from the above information we see that
each online analysing tool has own means, criteria and different
information to distribute. On the whole, some of them were not that easy
and simple to use, yet they provide as with expectant information and
disinfected solutions. Therefore, our succeeder for this test
is ThreatExpert. But bear in mind that I have not measure and compare
all the online tool-kits for analysing the files, just the ones listed
in the previous section. For furthermore, please refer to the following
article that was publish in 2010 by Lenny Zeltser
[MalwareAnalysisToolkit].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, we found out that the chosen files are malware. Likewise,
can harm our computer in different methods. Yet we got an information
for some, for instance how to disinfected the computer. Therefore, we
made a comparison table to scale the best online analysing tool for
malware. Where total number is 6 tools, and different score rank. The
first one is TheratExpert, secondly is Virustotal.com and the third is
Netscty. Still all of mentioned tools score difference with one point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIXES&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1 is configuration of the virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your IT infrastructure could be taken under the shoulder of
professionals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founder Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Macedonian government has announced to open a CERT agency.
This news was not only shock to us, but to everyone else, indeed.
However, we are supporting this initiative and hope that will be able to
elaborate and corporate within organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macedonian situation in a field of information and cyber security is not
on very surprising or signification level. Therefore our main goal is to
increase and merge the collaboration with neighbour countries as well as
with international organizations and agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, our belief lies that we will be able to bring better
understanding of very important issues that concern information and
cyber security, and to lead to better national awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this matter, our company will continue to expend the partnership as
well as international collaboration. We will constantly checking for
updates for existing solutions, also to search for new solutions to
update our offerings and services. And further development of our
projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this brochure we would like to introduce you with our company
profile, such as, our services, partners, clients, projects and our blog
posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Link to PDF version of the brochure is on the following link:

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify possible infection of
malware into the wireshark capture file. The report should highlight the
following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download [not avaibale anymore]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find malware download in this pcap and extract malware or malwares
find out where malware was downloaded from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What malware …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify possible infection of
malware into the wireshark capture file. The report should highlight the
following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download [not avaibale anymore]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find malware download in this pcap and extract malware or malwares
find out where malware was downloaded from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What malware, malwares changes in system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&amp;amp;C Names and address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Document the process also where You found hints and how exactly You
did it (you need to show Your thought and communication process – please
write a summary of it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write an incident report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we have to consider the malware analysis report reminders,
please refer to [1] or [2]. Additional, analysis it is stated into the
Analysis section, where we explain the techniques, filter tools, gather
knowledge, links, etc. Structure of the laboratory report is first to
present analysis with details information. Malware and infections
description are described. Finally the conclusion made of all analysis
will be concise in summary section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;ANALYSIS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to open and use the above file, firstly we have to download
the wireshark tool. Where the main goal and purpose for wireshark
application is to analysis a network protocols from captured file.
Therefore please refer to the following link:
&lt;a href="http://www.wireshark.org/"&gt;http://www.wireshark.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Useful links for future use, please refer to [3, 4, 5 and 6]. On figure
1 it shows the Graphic Interface of Wireshark application with running
filter: http protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 1: Wireshark application, filter: http protocol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, from the figure 1 we can see that there is a lot of traffic
generated by the user. Therefore we have to apply and additional filter
rules, which will help and guide for better and easy analysis. As we go
through each generated http protocol traffic we can conclude that the
user generated and has been visiting different source, where can be
potential threat for the organization and personal use with a different
malicious code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to filter only the http protocols on port 80 with a header
GET, we should use the following filter: http.request.method == “GET”.
Where this filter will narrow down the results that are presented into
the captured file. In spite of the filter above it helps a lot, yet
there is still a lot of traffic generated, consequently we have to
utilize an additional filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another extremely useful wireshark option we used, was Analyze → Follow
TCP Stream which shows communication between IP addresses in more
readable and useful way: shows DNS name for the IP and if file was
downloaded gives filetype and name. We discovered that IP address
79.137.237.34 belongs to accord-component.ru. When we accessed the site
with various web browsers, all of them showed that it contained malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    GET /serial/index.php HTTP/1.1Accept: */*Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NETCLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0)Connection: Keep-AliveHost: accord-component.ruHTTP/1.1 200 OKServer: nginxDate: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 23:07:18GMTContent-Type: text/htmlTransfer-Encoding: chunkedConnection: keep-aliveX-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.2Content-Encoding: gzip&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another suspicious IP was 86.63.168.101, where from this IP address brought us to&lt;br&gt;domain name zumlelao.com, but it was un-accessible from browsers. Wireshark showed the User downloaded file 4.exe from zumlelao.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="brush: php"&gt;GET /load.php?file=0HTTP/1.1Accept: image/jpeg, application/x-ms-application, image/gif,application/xaml+xml, image/pjpeg, application/x-ms-xbap, */*Accept-Language: etUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NETCLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0)Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateHost: zumlelao.comConnection: Keep-AliveHTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 21:55:02GMTServer: Apache/2X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.17Cache-Control: publicContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=4.exeContent-Transfer-Encoding: binaryVary: Accept-EncodingContent-Encoding: gzipContent-Length: 10666Keep-Alive: timeout=1, max=100Connection: Keep-AliveContent-Type: application/octet-stream

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we can always use an Find function, which will help as to
identify certain traffic or site. Figure 2 demonstrated the usage of the
Find function, accessible from menu Edit -&gt; Find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 2: Wireshark, Find function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other IP addresses that were generated/extracted first the ones with
malware detected:
&lt;code&gt;79.137.237.34 -accord-component.ru; 86.63.168.101 zumlelao.com&lt;/code&gt;. Other
IP’s are:
&lt;code&gt;173.194.32.32 (33,34,41,50,51,52,58,59,60,63), 192.168.123.1, 193.184.164.159 (174,176,185), 193.40.252.83, 193.88.71.156, 194.126.108.69 (70), 194.126.124.136, 194.204.14.49, 195.222.15.74, 199.7.48.190, 209.85.173.95, 123.168.24.204 (209,221,225,229,235), 79.137.237.34, 80.252.91.41 (61), 69.171.228.11, 23.32.89.55, 23.32.99.172, 216.34.181.45 (48), 213.168.24.26, 90.190.148.34 (40), 86.63.168.101, 82.98.58.48, 81.19.238.61.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we run or analysis the above domain names into the google we will
automatic indicated that the zumlelao.com it is an before reported as a
malware site and the second too. Therefore the analysis and the
infection of details of malware are highlighted into the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;INFECTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the above captured file presents traffic generated by the user,
that can be threat for the organization, home user, etc. As from the
previous section demonstrates how to identify if the generated traffic
has infected or has the user visit the malicious code sites. This
section identifies the malicious code and displays their details.
Moreover, the zumlelao.com host it is reported previous as malicious
code site. For this purpose we gather the help from the following link:
&lt;a href="http://sopport.clean-mx.de/"&gt;http://sopport.clean-mx.de/&lt;/a&gt;. Here is the reported malicious,
suspicious code from the above host in the table bellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, figure 3 is proving the analysis made through the
wireshark, were one of the above links has been access, for more details
clink on the above link and points in a figure 3:A and B.&lt;/p&gt;

and the IP initiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to get the file itself for analysis, we used Netresec’s
Network Miner 2.1 http://www.netresec.com/?page=NetworkMiner. In Files
menu, it shows all packets as files.We uploaded 4.exe.octet-stream to
virustotal.com – 30 Antivirus software identified as malware Virustotal
link:
&lt;a href="http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=d6ee8736cd2eae8571b193b28b59dff33e9607237f78b0888d69c70f241bb04b-%201323098398"&gt;http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=d6ee8736cd2eae8571b193b28b59dff33e9607237f78b0888d69c70f241bb04b-1323098398&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trojan.Generic.KD malwares usually are classified as Backdoors. It
infects executable files in the system and its main goal is to make
backdoor into the system. It changes registry. In some cases it can put
payload on the infected system, slow it down and make internet browsing
difficult and time consuming. Aim of the malware can be stealing
information or gaining partial/full access of the victim’s system. On
the other hand, Trojan.Generic.KD malwares are difficult to remove from
infected computers. From VirusTotal analysis we can see that various
antivirus software can discover and identify Trojan.Generic.KD.438472.
Therefore one can remove malware by downloading antivirus software
provided by F-Secure, Comodo, Microsoft, Sophos, Symantec, DrWeb, etc.
Here is an example from Dr.Web how to delete Trojan.Generic.KD malware
&lt;a href="http://www.drwebhk.com/en/virus_removal/694829/Trojan.Generic.KD.53986.html"&gt;http://www.drwebhk.com/en/virus_removal/694829/Trojan.Generic.KD.53986.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our case we downloaded Dr.Web CureIt (free edition for home PCs,
which discovered the malware and removed it) –
&lt;a href="http://www.freedrweb.com/download+cureit/?nc=t&amp;amp;lng=en"&gt;http://www.freedrweb.com/download+cureit/?nc=t&amp;amp;lng=en&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before continuing to disinfect the system, please read and understand
the massage delivered through this forum:
&lt;a href="http://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=35407"&gt;http://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=35407&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays malicious codes, infection of the system is one of the highest
vector of production work everyday of the organizations. Therefore,
different approaches, advance analysis, troubleshooting, etc. has to be
applicable and stated in every organization. Leaking of data,
information, access of network (internal and external) can be very
harmful for organization and even the home usage of computers.
Therefore, this laboratory report main aim is to provide the reader to
be able to conduct advance analysis of system and their identification
of infection within the wireshark network analysis tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above sections in Analysis and in the Infection we have to
follow the steps and links that will help us for a further work.
Meanwhile, the captured generated traffic from the distributed file has
indeed indicated that the system it is infected. Were as an prove we
demonstrate an screen-shot, figure 3, that one of the infected link has
been visited. Likewise, the system of this user is infected. Thus
infection identified name is: TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen3, where we do supply
and the disinfecting stepwise solution with the above link. Closing, as
there are many different ways, tools, process for analysing the
malicious code behaviours in system this laboratory report is supplying
the reader with advance and stepwise solution for identifying the
infection of the system within advance network analysis wireshark
application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;WORKLOAD&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made analysis on the virtual Windows 7 machine. For virtualization we
used VirtualBox. During analysis each of group member did the same
analysis to cross - reference the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We basically used the following tools: Wireshark, Network Miner and
&lt;a href="http://virustotal.com/"&gt;virustotal.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the 25 of June 2012, the Macedonian website of Ministry of
Interior (MVR) was defaced by Kosovo Network Security (KNS) group, below
figure. However, after we have noticed and some of the social networking
sites have informed me, I was concern to find out what just have
happened …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Purpose&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the 25 of June 2012, the Macedonian website of Ministry of
Interior (MVR) was defaced by Kosovo Network Security (KNS) group, below
figure. However, after we have noticed and some of the social networking
sites have informed me, I was concern to find out what just have
happened and how did happen, and of course how they have done it. So for
this purpose, I have done some digging into details, about the previous
defacement activities of this very important government site. But before
we continue with more details, let just talk about the situation of
yesterday and what did the authorities take protective measures steps
and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, 25 June 2012 at 19:38, one friend have updated his status in
one of the social networking sites, as follows: “Хакован
&lt;a href="http://mvr.gov.mk/"&gt;http://mvr.gov.mk/&lt;/a&gt;” (Hacked &lt;a href="http://mvr.gov.mk/"&gt;http://mvr.gov.mk/&lt;/a&gt;). And it made me
extremely intrigue to see what actually have just happened. The below
figure, displays the message spread from the KNS group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screenshot from the mvr.gov.mk defaced version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, what makes the situation even more interesting is that after
the report that the site was defaced the authorities have taken a
measures steps to fix the issue, by either shutting down the server or
restoring the content of the site from the backup. Then after one or two
minutes the site was defaced again. I did not want to lose the time and
the nervous to check every five or ten minutes to see when it will be
back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, after 15 hours, or one stressful – hard core night for the
administrators of the site, the usability and functionalities where back
as normal, let just see how long will stay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the current post the idea is to give and overview, of what
actually is going on when it comes to case of cyber space, cyber
security issues in Macedonia. The structure of this post is introduces
first with the issue, or the problem that actuality made me to write
this post. Followed by the background investigation about the previous
defacement activities on the Ministry of Interior website in Macedonia.
Then with the background investigation about the KNS group, moreover,
with the self pen-testing site with different attacking methodologies.
And finally, closing by with a conclusion and action plan that should be
taken, for hence actions. This post does not only involves the public
sector, but even and the private sector too. Those agencies,
organizations are too much careless and do not take any actions of
securing their IT assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministry of Interior in Macedonia site offers different online services.
The site primary idea is to inform the inhabitance about the news,
actions, useful information, public relations, analysis and statistics;
international cooperation and legislation; and finally the services. And
secondly is to give and opportunities to the population scheduling of
service, if their document is issued, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one short sentence, this site, for some people, it may be very useful
or not. However, I need to empathize that the site is only available in
Macedonian language, nor Albania, nor English version. So, in simple
conclusion this site is only useful for Macedonian speakers, and not for
foreigners, yet still represents one of very important public service,
government agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in the next section we will discuses the previous
defacement and hacking attacks of this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service of this site, or the domain first was registered in 22
October 2003, and unfortunate I do not remember when was first time
available and published. However, in the pass years I have heard many
times that this site was defaced and hacked, but still no actions or
results were shown. Therefore, it made me very interesting to find out,
if this defacement activities where notified and when and how many
where. For this purpose I have use a site service that I know few years
ago, the &lt;a href="http://www.zone-h.org/"&gt;Zone-H&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover,
&lt;a href="http://www.zone-h.org/"&gt;Zone-H&lt;/a&gt; is neither responsible for the reported
computer crimes nor it is directly or indirectly involved with them, it
is just and simple site where collects the cybercrime activities
notified anonymously. The bellow figure provides a details of previous
reported/notified cybercrime activities of MVR site in Macedonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In details, total notifications are 4 of which 2 are single IP and 2 are
mass defacements. The first mass defacement was done in 29 July 2009,
when the site use a OS: Windows 2000, then in 2011 it was the
re-defacement and the server operating system is Windows 2008. Followed
by the other massive defacement in this year 2012 in March 18, and same
year, few days before the current attack, 22 of June it was
re-defacement. And the attack, defacement that we write for it was not
notified or reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these data, and schedule, we can come to a conclusion that the site
was defaced just 3 days before the mass defacement attack, so it might
be a simple warning, to taken an action before something goes really
wrong. But most probably, non of those administrators, or authorities
did not taken any serious actions, until the case yesterday appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Details&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to do an analysis of what actually have happened, we need to
take some actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we have done a simple web sniffer, to find out what kind of
system, and services the site, server is using. If we request the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields"&gt;HTTP
Request Header&lt;/a&gt;
we will receive an HTTP Response Header with a following data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    Status: HTTP/1.1 200 OKCache-Control: privateContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.0Set-Cookie: ASP.NET_SessionId=3lti3gep3usg4255ggf34tjn; path=/; HttpOnlyX-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727X-Powered-By: ASP.NETDate: Tue, 26 Jun 2012 08:18:34 GMTConnection: closeContent-Length: 103773

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above data, is useful in a sense that provides as an information
about the Server and the ASP.Net Version. Then, if we want to find more
details about the open and close ports and operating system we can use
the &lt;a href="http://nmap.org/"&gt;nmap&lt;/a&gt; tool with the following command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nmap -O -v IP-Address&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the results will be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    PORT STATE SERVICE21/tcp open ftp80/tcp open httpRunning (JUST GUESSING) : Microsoft Windows Vista|2008|7 (89%)

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the web sniffing and from the OS version scanning we can assume
that the server is running Microsoft Windows 2008. The current
vulnerabilities and possible exploitations are visible on the &lt;a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/"&gt;Microsoft
Security
Bulletins&lt;/a&gt;
website. By knowing the vulnerabilities it is very easy task to find out
a way either to commit DoS attack or remote server access. However, in
this post we will not go into details and exploitation descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the KNS, we assume the domain is followed:
&lt;a href="http://kns-team.com/"&gt;http://kns-team.com&lt;/a&gt;. However, the site is down,
therefore, we will have to understand who is behind this domain
registration. Therefore, we will use the whois database to understand
more, or even we can use another site that have been defaced by this
group to find out more. So there is the list presented the members in
the groups and their archive of notified defaced sites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zone-h.org/archive/notifier=cracker-besi"&gt;rAcKeR-BeSi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zone-h.org/archive/notifier=L0wHacker"&gt;L0wHacker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sLizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X-r00t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SpyHackz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Facebook fan page is:
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kosova-Network-Security/176195849098989"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kosova-Network-Security/176195849098989&lt;/a&gt;.
For more info I was short of time to do more digging, but I hope that
someone will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Action&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After understanding the details about the MVR site, operating system and
their server services, and information about the KNS, it is time to take
an action of trying to see how vulnerable is MVR site, and to see if
these lads had very difficult time of defacing the content of the site,
or even gaining access to the server-side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before, we carry on, I want to stress out that this section is not
to give you an idea how, or knowledge to exploit or use any
vulnerabilities to deface or gain access to the site. We will just
demonstrate you a very simple
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt; exploit of MVR
site that we have found a vulnerability, figure below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of exploitation by XSS vulnerability, mvr.gov.mk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore, from this very simple and easy exploitation of XSS
vulnerability of the MVS site we will be able to run more advance and
complicated shell scripts to gain access and maintain access of the
server. Our initial idea is not to show you how to do it, but to expose
to the audience that actually hence actions is need it. And we hope that
the administrators, developers and the authorities will take an action
of mitigating the risk, and further vulnerabilities of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Macedonia, cyber space, cyber crime, cyber security, cyber warefare,
cyber terrorism are actually unknown words, terminology. They are not
even specified or added into the Macedonian dictionary, nor in IT
dictionary. However, this is not the first or least defacement, attack
that has happened in Macedonia, nor the first attack that has been done,
implemented by neighbor countries, or someone else. I just don’t
understand why people in this country are so careless about how to
protect their IT assets, and everything else, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is not an issue that we do not have specialists to
conduct a pen-testing to the sites and services that not only the
government agencies are offering but even the banks and private sectors
as well. We even have a cyber crime unit in Ministry of Interior, and
one of very successful information security research and development
laboratory in Macedonia: &lt;a href="http://www.zeroscience.mk/en/"&gt;Zero Science
Lab&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the &lt;a href="http://cybersecurity.mk/icsap/"&gt;ICSAP – Interactive
Cyber Security Awareness Program&lt;/a&gt;,
Macedonia project, developed by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in final conclusion, I would like to recommend the
authorities to take actions about the above described activities done by
KNS and hope that the security awareness will boost up, and the further
actions will be considered of securing cyber space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to create a solution
and instructions for testing an IDS^1^ systems usefulness for detecting

develop/download/find/whatever a SNORT configuration (rulesets,

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to create a solution
and instructions for testing an IDS^1^ systems usefulness for detecting
attacks against a wordpress site. In addition, we have to
develop/download/find/whatever a SNORT configuration (rulesets,
preprocessors, whatever) that performs better than the default
configuration in previous post. By better we mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less false positives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less false negatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The objectives are contradictory so the rule of thumb is one false
    negative per 10 false positives eg. solution with 10 false positives
    and 2 false negatives is better than the solution with 100 false
    positives and 1 false negatives, but the solution with 10 false
    positives and 1 false negative is better than the solution with 1
    false positive and 2 false negatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attack is defined by a single invocation of all the test scripts in
    a row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the new rules have to be able to detect not only the default
attacks that are set to a default snort configuration, yet they have to
be able to detect SQL injection, brute force password, apache killer
script, pytbull, etc. Furthermore, in figure 1 we are illustrating the
scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 1: Illustration of Scenario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the proposal section we will present two proposals that
have been submitted due to this laboratory test and additionally in
result section we will highlighted the identification numbers made by
snort set new rules. In section appendixes we will provide you with more
details configuration procedures, configuration of VM’s – Virtual
Machines, attacks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, closing with an conclusion and the results of best set of rules
made of the proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SETUP of SNORT&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To setup snort in a right way, that will work for the second Host only
network please following the instruction link provided with a full
description and configuration of snort [SNORT2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;PROPOSALS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total two proposals are presented in next sub-sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;a href="http://www.tud.ttu.ee/~t061780/attacks/robert.rules"&gt;http://www.tud.ttu.ee/~t061780/attacks/robert.rules&lt;/a&gt; to your Snort.
On your Snort machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    cd /etc/snort/ruleswget http://www.tud.ttu.ee/~t061780/attacks/robert.rules

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have the rules, add them to your snort conf file (default
/etc/snort/snort.conf). To do that inser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;include $RULE_PATH/robert.rules&lt;/code&gt; somewhere with rest of the rules after
line 800. Run Snort and test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the following rules: &lt;a href="http://predragtasevski.com/src/predrag.rules"&gt;http://predragtasevski.com/src/predrag.rules&lt;/a&gt;.
To be able to insert the snort rules in to the snort file please double
check where it is located. You can find the location with the following
command: find / -name snort.conf Before you continue please change the
IP address to your server address on line number #6, example alert tcp
any any -&gt; 192.168.56.X where x is your octet. Then to add the
following rules at the conf file do the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat predrag.rules &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; snort.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is time to start or restart snort. It should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After executing the above proposal we will highlight the results into
the table bellow. Result are presented from the total amount of reports,
registered alerts in the snort. This is done by help of web interface of
Basic Analysis and Security Engine in addition Analysis Console for
Intrusion Databases (ACID) project tool [ACID]. Therefore, the result
from the proposals are highlighted below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1: Details of total report numbers of alerts made by SNORT and the
different proposal rule sets. Details of the attacks conducted in the
table are presented in appendixes section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, figure 2 is presenting the pine chart of the total number
alerts recognized by Snort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 2: Total number of Alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, figure 3 is representing the pine chart of total number of
unique alerts recognized by Snort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 3: Total number of Unique Alerts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above results we came to conclusion that the new applied rules
were successful and were able to recognize alerts more then the default
rule set of Snort. Meanwhile, only proposal 2 was able to recognized an
SQL injections without any additional tweaking. Although proposal 1 was
still useful, on the other hand the best solution is when we combine the
both rule sets proposals. Then the Snort is able to recognized an
significant number of total alerts and additionally for our laboratory
report more interesting is unique total number alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closing, even the default Snort rules configuration is good, yet when
you tweak it by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your own needs, you will have much better IDS system for your network.
In future it should be recommended always refer to [snort_rules], to
gather more available advance Snort rules, made by experts. Where will
help you to configure and setup Snort IDS system to detecting attacks
against a wordpress site, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snort by default does not detect this, where in applying the proposal 2
rules, it did detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIX 5&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test Snort and acidbase, perform a portscan of the Snort host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo nmap -p1-65535 -sV -sS -O 192.168.56.102&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to create a solution

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to create a solution
and instructions for testing an IDS\^1 systems usefulness for detecting
attacks against a wordpress site. In addition, a repeatable process to
evaluate vendor claims. Whatever passive IDS system sample delivered as
a VM or a dedicated box. Creating the IDS system itself is out of scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process must be detailed enough so that somebody else can get the
same results when applying that. The “other person” is expected to have
IT knowledge sufficient to install and run a Linux desktop. Budget
requirements: Modest – 2 machines + a tester (Joe) + networking
equipment to connect the two machines and an IDS together. The process
must test at least the following attacks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Port scan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SYN flood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Regular” DoS overwhelming attack (Ab)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optionally the process may test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;slowloris/pyloris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache Range header DoS vulnerability
&lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org/security/CVE-011-3192.txt"&gt;http://httpd.apache.org/security/CVE-011-3192.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attack targeting any other fairly recent (not older than 3-4 years)
known vulnerability that could in theory apply to the target system
(wordpress server)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the competition rules are: The highest number of attacks
evaluated. Limits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each attack must be relevant eg. if it attacks IIS it’s NOT relevant.
If it attacks Windows RPC it’s not relevant. If it attacks some other
CMS eg. Drupal it’s NOT relevant. * Basically equivalent attacks count
as one (different port scanners for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must be able to explain in broad terms what the attack does eg:
attacks the vulnerability #X in Apache server If the #attacks is
equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lab instaractions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install 3 VM-s: Attacker IDS and Target&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
​1. Make sure all VM-s have two network adapters: NAT and Host-Only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Install Snort and it’s GUI called “acidbase” on IDS
&lt;a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SnortIDS"&gt;https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SnortIDS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. Install Apache, Mysql and WordPress on Target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​4. Execute an attack on Attacker towards the IP address on the Host
Only network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​5. Take notice of the results displayed on Acid console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​6. Reset counters, move on to next attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, illustration 1 describes the overview of above scenario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 1: Lab 5 Illustration of Scenario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, setup procedure of snort, secondly available proposals and
thirdly illustrating the results and the functionality of proposals.
Finally, closing this laboratory report with conclusion. In addition,
appendixes is configuration of VM’s – Virtual Machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SETUP of SNORT&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To setup snort in a right way, that will work for the second Host only
network please following the instruction link provided with a full
description and configuration of snort [SNORT2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the setup and configuration to run snort on the second
interface use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;snort -c /etc/snort/snort/conf -i eth1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;PROPOSALS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total three proposals and each one is highlighted in the next
sub-sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Set up IDS (Snort) and WordPress on the first PC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Install Ubuntu server on the second PC . Then install all attacking
tools there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```wget enos.itcollege.ee/\~avein/lab4i.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sudo sh lab4i.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    After that you should have:- ```ab.sh``` – DoS attack script – uses ab to generate traffic flood- ```apachekiller.pl``` – Apachekiller attack script More info: http://www.hackersgarage.com/apache-killer-denial-of-service-flaw-in-apache-webserver.html- ```README.txt``` – extra instructions- ```scan.sh``` - Port scanning script - uses nmap- ```sloworis.pl``` - Sloworis attack script More info: http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/- ```synf.sh``` - syn flood attack script - uses hping33. Start your IDS/wordpress server and the server with attack tools. 4. Run each attack tool ONE AT A TIME (targeting the wordpress/IDS server of course) . Monitor the logs/notifications on yours IDS system (SNORT) and check whether wordpress site is still accessible. Let each attack tool run 2 minutes, then stop the attack by pressing CTRL+C on the terminal window where the attack tool is running. The only exeption is port scan- its better to wait until it finishes. After each attack save the IDS log and wait atlest 5 minutes before trying next tool (to give server time to recover). Best practice is to manually check if the server load is at normal (one can use htop for that).a) To run DoS attack:```sh ab.sh {target} eg sh ab.sh 192.168.56.101```b) For port scan:```sh scan.sh {target IP} eg sh scan.sh 192.168.56.101```c) For Syn flood (with hping3)```sh synf.sh {target} eg synf.sh 192.168.56.101/wordpress```d) For Sloworis attack:```perl slowloris.pl -dns {target} eg perl sloworis.pl -dns 192.168.56.101/wordpress```e) For Apachekiller attack:```perl apachekiller.pl {target IP} eg perl apachekiller.pl 192.168.56.101```## PROPOSAL 2### IntroFor this scenario we need to run several different attacks and scans to be able to compare the results with different IDS setups and rulesets. We might also want to test it with legitimate traffic to see that we dont get false positives in our alarms. We dont have that much legitimate traffic possibilities with 1 blog on our servers right now, but if we start tweaking the IDS false positives becomes an important metric and we might want to test normal usage and create traffic to run with tcpreplay for example. My proposal is to test the IDS with pytbull running on BackTrack. Pytbull is IDS testing framework and BackTrack a Linux ditribution. I will assume that we have WordPress server with running default Snort set up on it and working. No extensive testing has been done with different snort setups so we might have to tune the methods, but basic things should be covered.### DL and install BackTrack- &lt;a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/downloads/" target="_blank"&gt;backtrack-linux.org/downloads/&lt;/a&gt;Install it rather than running a live version for this scenario. Boot it up in default mode, start GUI and launch installation from desktop. Default login root / toor. Standard setup comes with pytbull and several pieces of software the IDS test-system depends on like nmap, hping3, nikto and others.### Setup connectionsConnect the machines and install ftp and ssh on server. We need ftp to get snort alert files and ssh to run attacks against.```apt-get install vsftpd openssh-server```### Setup pytbullYou will find pytbull from ```/pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/``` or Applications -&gt; BackTrack -&gt; Information Gathering -&gt; Network Analysis -&gt; IDS IPS Identification -&gt; pytbull when using the GUI. Change the configuration file values to have correct connection information, user credentials and locations of dependencies. Here you also select which test modules out of the 9 available you want to run. ClientSideAttacks needs extra configuration.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cd /pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gedit config.cfg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example conf file: http://www.tud.ttu.ee/\~t061780/attacks/config.cfg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now get custom DoS module to have hping SYN flood and ApacheBench DoS
tests covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cd modules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mv denialOfService.py denialOfService.py-backup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wget http://www.tud.ttu.ee/\~t061780/attacks/denialOfService.py&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to refer to Pytbull documentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    ### Run```/pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/pytbull -t WP/Snort server IP;```If everything works you will find html report file under /reports. If you have problems add -d on run for debugging.###(optional) SlowlorisTo have slowloris attack test for pytbull we need to get custom slowloris that allows to set how many packets to send because we dont want the tests to run forever. I added argument s that tells the script to stop after we have sent s packets.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cd /pentest/stressing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wget www.tud.ttu.ee/\~t061780/attacks/slowloris.pl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowloris attack has been written into DoS module, you have to uncomment
it. Lines 47-52.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gedit /pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/modules/denialOfService.py&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    ## PROPOSAL 3For this proposal I will suggest to use open source tool OpenVas for vulnerability scanning, to test our IDS system. It contains many security tools integrated. The security and analysis tools are: Nikto, nmap, ike-scan, snmpwalk, amap, ldapsearch, SLAD (John-the-Ripper, Chkrootkit, LSOF, ClamAV, Tripwire, TIGER, logwatch, trapwatch, lm-sensors, snort and ovaldi), pnscan, portbunny, strobe, w3af, etc.Instructions of installation process, for further more information please refer to &lt;a href="http://www.openvas.org/setup-and-start.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.openvas.org/setup-and-start.html&lt;/a&gt;### Step 1: Configure OBS Repository```sudo apt-get -y install python-software-propertiessudo add-apt-repository "deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:/OpenVAS:STABLE:/v4/xUbuntu_10.04/./"sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys BED1E87979EAFD54 sudo apt-get update

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Quick-Install OpenVAS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    sudo apt-get -y install greenbone-security-assistant gsd openvas-cli openvas-manager openvas-scanner openvas-administrator sqlite3 xsltproc

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Quick-Start OpenVAS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(copy and paste whole block, during first time you will be asked to set
a password for user “admin”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    test -e /var/lib/openvas/CA/cacert.pem || sudo openvas-mkcert -qsudo openvas-nvt-sync test -e /var/lib/openvas/users/om || sudo openvas-mkcert-client -n om -i sudo /etc/init.d/openvas-manager stopsudo /etc/init.d/openvas-scanner stopsudo openvassdsudo openvasmd --migratesudo openvasmd --rebuildsudo killall openvassdsleep 15sudo /etc/init.d/openvas-scanner startsudo /etc/init.d/openvas-manager startsudo /etc/init.d/openvas-administrator restartsudo /etc/init.d/greenbone-security-assistant restarttest -e /var/lib/openvas/users/admin || sudo openvasad -c add_user -n admin -r Admin

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 4: Log into OpenVAS as “admin”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;https://localhost:9392/&lt;/code&gt; or start &lt;code&gt;“gsd”&lt;/code&gt; on a command line as a
regular user (not as root!). Optional we can use and the Slowloris and
Pyloris DoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download link for Slowloris is:
&lt;a href="http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/slowloris.pl"&gt;http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/slowloris.pl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above solution and tool will help us to check and test our IDS
system usefulness. It tests the following attacks: Port scan, SYN flood,
DoS, etc. The results are presented with nice GUI interface. For more
info about the project please refer to
&lt;a href="http://www.openvas.org/"&gt;www.openvas.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After executing the above proposal we will highlight the results.
Nevertheless, only the Proposal 1 was able to run the test. Others two,
Proposal 2 and Proposal 3 were unsuccessful of installation process and
configuration and to run the attacks. Moreover, the result are presented
from the total amount of reports, registered alerts in the snort. This
is done by help of web interface of Basic Analysis and Security Engine
in addition Analysis Console for Intrusion Databases (ACID) project tool
[ACID]. Therefore, the result from the Proposal 1 and from the rest are
highlighted below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proposal 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DoS – registered alerts: 2;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port scan : 8;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;synf.sh: 1344;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slowloris.pl: 1782;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;apachekiller.pl: not working;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposal 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pytbull: 0, the message was: Error: FTP error, 550 failed to open
file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposal 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   Too complicated to be configured and installed. The instructions and
the procedures should be more easy. After few hours of configuring
and test, tweaks are is still not working. Yet there are many good
tutorials how to configure OpenVAS please refer [OpenVas1] and
[OpenVas2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primarily, setting-up IDS, the Snort, it is not an easy task to
complete. On the other hand, configuring, installing, etc. the testing
tools for IDS system is even more complicated. Therefore, the Proposal 1
has the best solution and installation process of the test tools.
Despite, that it was the only one that worked. Finally, recommendation
for the IDS solutions and in addition to the penetrating tools to test
the usefulness of IDS has to be more simple and stepwise solution.
However, the above scenario and proposals are great tools and solutions
for a future reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIXES&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1 is the configuration of the attacker virtual machine, in more
detail Blacktrack distribution. Secondly, Appendix 2 is the ubuntu
wordpress configuration server and additional is the configuration and
setup process and refer links of IDS Snort virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the costs of nowadays
most known attack  DDOS, leak of credit card numbers, infected machine
and never the less sending spam for 1 000 000 (one million) people.
There are few points that should be presented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where did we discovered …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;PURPOSE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the costs of nowadays
most known attack  DDOS, leak of credit card numbers, infected machine
and never the less sending spam for 1 000 000 (one million) people.
There are few points that should be presented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where did we discovered the information (links or sources)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of source of communication we used, for instance: instant
    messing, ICQ, IRC, which contact we have gather the information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the prices for the above attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we must bear in mind that collecting the above information
it is presented to a numerous affected sources ( i.e. Website, news,
forums, IRC chat,etc.). By visiting the source can lead you to a virus,
trojan, malicious code, malware, etc. Which can damage your system.
Therefore, we are going to use virtual environment to find our demands.
In addition, we will use different languages and different search
engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction of report is separated by tasks section. Where each section
is presented with the source, communication type and the costs of the
service. In addition, in Appendix 1 we give the configuration of virtual
environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the conclusion made of all collected data will be concise in
conclusion section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;TASKS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following list is the numeration of the tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DDoS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit Card Numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infected Machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spam for 1 000 000 people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TASK 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source where we can find information about the cost of DDoS attacks are
provided in Russian most known [Hackzone] forum. This is the source will
give as more of the answers. But again be careful when you accessing
this site. It is on your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the following link we received an information about DDoS
attacks: [HackzoneDDoS]. With the following translated statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    The average price of service from $ 50 per day. Depends on the complexity of the &lt;em&gt;attacked site. Methods of payment accepted via WebMoney. The network is practically around the clock!Commands:http / https / icmp / post / syn / udp /Price:Day from $ 50Week from $ 350From $ 1200 per month(Prices may change depending of type and timing of orders on the complexity of the attacked site)Demo test for 5-10 minutes.Contact:Icq :20-**-29Inspections completed:hack-world.orgwww.xaker.nameforum.xaknet.ruMost of the DDoS attack service are around per day $ 50, here is an other source and contact details:Contact details Icq:22-**-327Icq:875-**3E-mail:anti**os@jab**r.ru

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above information is from the following link:
&lt;a href="http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/15608/"&gt;http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/15608/&lt;/a&gt;. Other sources that can be
found are with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the following links: &lt;a href="http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/16067/"&gt;http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/16067/&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/17187/"&gt;http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/17187/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we stated above that the price is from \$50 per day and it goes until
\$350 per month and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TASK 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of credit cards leaked in the web are numerous amount. The
prices are not that high as people expected. For card that comes from
European country is the highest price and for the other are much
cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here some information from the following link, leak from &lt;a href="http://www.hackzone.ru/memb/view/name/Support_BM/"&gt;Support_BM
Originar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;source is in Russian language, so for this report is translated to
English. From the source [CartNumber].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TASK 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays it is not hard to find an infected machine/computer. Because
most of the user PC’s are based with operating system Windows and are
most of them infected. I have try so hard to find infected machine
price, but until today, I did not come up with any good source.
Therefore, I would like if it is possible to add this source and discuss
this source and information with the fellow students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TASK 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spamming for one million people it sounds impossible, but still out
there someone is offering this service. Here is from Kazakhstan source
with the following information, translated in English:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    E-mail newsletter:1 post = 1 m., minimum order 10 000 posts.For large orders – big discounts!At present there is action: 10 000 tenge, we send 20 000 messages. + Action: 50 000 tenge, we send your letter to 360 000 email ardesov in Almaty, send 3 times in one month!The action is over, send a time.E-mail database:In Almaty:60 000 LEGAL Address – Almaty Yuredicheskie email addresses, the entire directory guide “our town” and directory site “Samruk Kazyna”430 000 – private address Almaty residents collected via mail search agent criteria:country, city, gender, age.Throughout Kazakhstan:240 000 – LEGAL person Kazakhstan LLP, Ltd., Inc., Ltd., etc. collected from various references such as “yellow pages” “compass” etc.3.4 million – individuals, all of Kazakhstan. – Collected through the mail search agent criteria: country, city, gender, age.P.S. you can build a base of email addresses to any city in Kazakhstan, or any other city in any other country, can you give us the criteria and we will collect your base, an example of criteria:I try, the city, Age, sex, online, not online.P.S. Legal mailings are engaged for 3 years, dispatching more than 5 years.To Order: +7-701-1**5575, +7 (727) -329-61-**.E-mail: d**z@i**ox.ru

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, for 10 000 KZT = 67.45 USD and the amount of message send are 20
000 spam. Then the price for one million spam is 3.372.5 USD without
discount. The above links is from the following source [Rassilka.kz].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to generalize that from the above information we see that
for any service that we looked for, it has a price. Value that are
different in other countries and currencies. Yet, before you start this
research make sure that you are not using your local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, I have used an virtual environment to be able to collect all
the above data. Because the sites, forums, links, etc. are infected with
malicious code, or can be easily traceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, we utter gather as much as possible different sources and
different prices. Most expensive is the spam for one million people,
second is DDoS attacks and never the last is to gain an credit card
numbers from different countries and different price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more info please refer to following source [QuinStreet Inc] why I
have chose Russia as the main source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any computer user who is engaged in a virtual world has a virtual life.
Virtual life is a catchall term used to describe the involvement and
presence of an individual in any chosen virtual world or simulated
digital environment. Virtual world …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Authors: Predrag Tasevski, Marco Gavazzi and Lasse Hyyrynen&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any computer user who is engaged in a virtual world has a virtual life.
Virtual life is a catchall term used to describe the involvement and
presence of an individual in any chosen virtual world or simulated
digital environment. Virtual world is a genre of online community that
often takes the form of a computer-based simulated environment, through
which users can interact with one another and use and create objects.
And virtual community is a social network of individuals who interact
through specific media, potentially crossing geographical and political
boundaries in order to pursue mutual interests or goals. Therefore, we
have choose this problem as an issue of the general drastically grow of
the population of having access to the computers and Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many online service available to demonstrate an virtual life
environment for different purpose, for example:
&lt;a href="http://secondlife.com/"&gt;http://secondlife.com/&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.ict-virtuallife.eu/blog/?cat=8"&gt;http://ict-virtuallife.eu/&lt;/a&gt;,
etc. Nowadays the scholars and researchers are organizing workshops and
developing projects, to understand the meaning of second life and to
perceive the meaning of virtual life in different aggregate of
surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting topics about the second life – virtual life are that it
can be focus in many different aspects, example: virtual distance
education, on users – questionnaire on user needs, it can be compression
of virtual life with an second life, online shopping, medical purpose,
social networking, cross cultural study, modern world with GPS cell
phones, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the literature, people tend to construct their virtual
identity in a different way from the real one. Therefore, it is
extremely important to study both the aspects of the everyday life and
the presentation of the virtual self (Nagy, Péter, 2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, we are going to give an expectations and the comparison in
past few years and nowadays, what have change, what is expecting in the
future, etc. In addition we are devoting and explaining what are the
best methods in our opinion to be done to study the problem in a deep
allegory. But on the other hand we are openhanded in impression what
kind of problems could rise do to analyze this problem in the field of
Internet psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Expectations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, a general increase of people using the Internet (maybe not
so strong as some years ago but still really dynamic), and a decreasing
of the average age of the users (Internet is really used among very
young people, thanks to all the social network really in fashion at the
present time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other data that we expect from our research project,
especially about the using of the Internet divided in the continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course in Asia there are more users than in any other place, but we
have to consider that this one is the most populated continent between
all the others…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can in this way expect the statistics of the world Internet
penetration rate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading these two graphics we can compare the quantity of people using
the Internet in general and the penetration grade of the Internet in the
last years, according to different continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can verify that even in continents with very few users of the Net
there has been a very strong increase of the users in the last period
(Oceania is the last continent about numbers of users of the Internet
with around 21 millions, but with a penetration rate of about 61% in
last years, the second one between all the other continents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe this phenomenon of the spreading of the usage of the Internet
is really strong, as we can see for other data (really superior than in
the rest of the world). A last statistic that we expect from our
research, this time about the usage of Internet by young people: the
case is only local (United States) but it’s significant of the
increasing of the usage of Internet in last years. About 80% of children
between the ages of 0 and 5 who use the Internet in the United States do
so on at least a weekly basis. The report, which was assembled using
data from seven recent studies, indicates that young children are
increasingly consuming all types of digital media, in many cases
consuming more than one type at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2010 Nielsen study suggests that 36% of children between the ages of 2
and 11 uses the computer system and the Internet massively. Altogether,
children between the ages of 8 and 10 spend about 5.5 hours each day
using computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Methods&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we will start with the method of analyzing influences between
virtual and real life and afterwords analyzing the influences between
virtual life can be done in a very wide variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questionnaires can be used to analyze users own believes on the
influences. For example a questionnaire can be used to study how the
user thinks his Internet activity has affected his social behavior in
the real world. Questionnaires can be conducted via social networks or
separate Internet applications, which make them an easy way to gather
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the modern world with GPS cell phones, the analysis can also be made
objectively with brute data analysis. People could be studied by
gathering information from their social network pages and by using some
GPS tracking software on their mobile phones. This way we can gather
both the amount of time used in social networks and the amount of time
spend in the real world. If the GPS tracking can be done in a large
enough scale we can also see how many people a person meets during a
certain time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third kind of a study could be a cross cultural study, where behaviors
between different cultures are compared to see how virtual life changes
the behavior. This doesn’t only mean spatial comparison, but also the
temporal comparison of Estonian culture in the year 1950 compared to
2010. This of course means that we must have a good knowledge of the
cultures before we make decisions on which changes are due to the second
life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cultural study would be good to conduct on a culture, where the
Internet will be introduced in the following years. This way we can see
the changes in 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Problems that could occur&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are obviously many problems that must be well thought before
continuing with the study. In the questionnaire choosing the group,
questions and the way to analyze the results will have a fairly big
impact on the conclusions. Because the group is huge and diverge (all
the Internet users in the world), it will be quite hard to predict
anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems with following people objectively is of course quite illegal in
almost all of the modern countries with Internet. This will effect the
group that can be followed, since we only get people who wants to be
followed. Because we only get a special subset of people to study, we
only can guarantee that the results we get applies to the people who
likes to be studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross-cultural studies are hard to compare, since there is quite a huge
number of variables that effect in human behavior, and it is usually
close to impossible to determine accurately which behavioral differences
would be due to virtual life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of our research project is mainly to try to reconsider a topic
that can seem really banal (second life? every research about the
Internet starts from second life!), but that we consider to be of ground
importance. It’s really important to keep monitored every short period
of time these data; that’s the only way to have a clear vision of the
topic to start further and more specific researches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, from all the above we can make a conclusion that it is
possible to have done this research through many methods and still there
are going it be rise many problems. The problems can be mainly in
cross-culture, and the social differences between one group and the
other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the present we must first understand the past. The
Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like
nothing before. The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and
computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration of
capabilities. The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting
capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for
collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers
without regard for geographic location.&lt;span id="more-113"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the
benefits of sustained investment and commitment to research and
development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early
research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia have
been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology
(Barry M. , et al., 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the
initial prototype of what is often called the National (or Global or
Galactic) Information Infrastructure. Its history is complex and
involves many aspects – technological, organizational, and community.
And its influence reaches not only to the technical fields of computer
communications but throughout society as we move toward increasing use
of online tools to accomplish electronic commerce, information
acquisition, and community operations(Barry M. , et al., 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likelihood, computers have changed the face of communication to an
extent that we can’t consider our routine life without presence of these
machines. With the availability of technologies like internet, instant
messaging, emailing and others, the computers has fast replaced
conventional means of communicating with each other(Communication Type,
2008).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one writes letter anymore. It’s been said that longhand or cursive is
no longer taught in grade school. No need for it. People don’t write
anymore. As technology defined the late Twentieth Century, we became
both closer together and further apart. People had more time for an
online chat via the fast growing Internet than they did for a day at the
park with a dear friend. That was bad. On the other hand, we connected
to people all over the world that we might not otherwise get to enjoy.
Today, computer technology constantly changes the way we communicate
(Friends of Time, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look through the history of computer communication from 1968 to
nowadays there are three unique market sectors: Data Communication,
Networking and Internet (Internetworking). Data communication is an
electronic transmission of information that has been encoded digitally
(as for storage and processing by computers). Computer Networking is an
interconnection of various computer systems located at different places.
In computer network two or more computers are linked together with a
medium and data communication devices for the purpose of communicating
data and sharing resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Internet is a network of networks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millions of computers all over the world are connected through the
Internet. Computer users on the Internet can contact one another
anywhere in the world. If your computer is connected to the Internet,
you can connect to millions of computers. You can gather information and
distribute your data. It is very much similar to the telephone
connection where you can talk with any person anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As digital media takes flight, the grand slam of computer communication
has arrived. Skype . It’s free, it’s live, and it’s real face time. Not
only can people talk, but they can see each other as they talk. There
are even Skype and “skype-like” apps for Smartphones. To an extent,
communication has a more human feel again. People can see friends and
family a world away and keep very close contact. And leave it to
teenagers to figure out how to make Skype the new bedroom powwow.
Teenagers simply turn it on and hang out. They may not even be talking
to each other, but they know the other person is there (Friends of Time,
2011). With a free access of the Internet though the wireless local area
network (WLAN 1) we can chat and talk with anyone from anywhere, without
the consideration of graphical location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet and computers are offering a wide range of communication
influence. We can communicate to text messages to your friends through
computers and communication tools provided by it. From emails and
newsletters to text chats and instant messaging, micro-blogging,
computers can help you to reach your friends, relatives, business
associates and others in the matter of few seconds. Communication tools
to communicate your voice messages without facing the geographical
restrictions. Voice mails and voice chats, brought revolutionary changes
how have computers changed the way we communicate. Business
communication with the help of audio and video conferencing. The
executives of different branches of a company, located in different
geographical locations, can communicate with each other and distances
can pose no hurdles in establishing these communication systems. Other
influence of computer communication are helping and proving the
education system of offering a distant learning, gaining a degree
without being at the university location, etc. One of the popular
concepts in nowadays communication is online social networking, instance
of communication, joining different online clubs and communicates with
individuals from various parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, imagine a day without computer in your room or on the
office desk. For instance no emails, no chatting, no instant messaging
and no web camera interactions, how we are going to feel? Therefore, we
all can understand how computers have changed the way we communicate.
Life can come to a standstill without computers and similar devices
around us. Consequently, communication through computers is an important
aspect of every individual today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of communicating through computer and Internet is that you
can practice it from any part of the world. All computer technology is
wonderful and the more access to communication the better. But it will
be a shame if the world becomes so shrouded in technology that good old
fashioned face to face people skills become a rare art instead of an
everyday norm.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, all the above describes how the computers changed the way we
communicate. This is because computers have become great contributors
towards the world of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a psychological “digital divide”? Are people who often use the

&lt;p&gt;Is there a psychological “digital divide”? Are people who often use the
Internet psychologically different from those who do not and in what
ways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet is changing the average citizens as much as did other
technologies, for instance: telephone, TV, computers, mobile phones etc.
The mainly province was to help the science, engineering, and business.
Many scholars, technologists, and social critics believe that these
changes and the Internet, in particular, are transforming economic and
social life (Robert , Micheal, Vicki, Sara, Tridas , &amp;amp; William , 1998).
In the past few years, the scholars have done many researches to make a
conclusion of difference in psychological and social tend of the
Internet to the citizens. Therefore, the term “digital divide” is the
gap that exists between those who have access to electronic and
Information Technology – Internet and those who do not (University of
Minnesota Duluth, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People use home computers and the Internet in many different ways and
for many purposes, including entertainment, education, information
retrieval, and communication. If people use the Internet mainly for
communication with others through e-mail, distribution lists, multiuser
dungeons, chats, and many other instant or voice messenger applications,
they might do so to augment traditional technologies of social contact,
expanding their number of friends and reducing the difficulty of
coordinating interaction with them. On the other hand, these
applications disproportionately reduce the costs of communication with
geographically distant acquaintances and strangers; as a result, a
smaller proportion of people’s total social contacts might be with
family and close friends. Yet other applications on the Internet,
particularly the World Wide Web, provide asocial entertainment that
could compete with social contact as a way for people to spend their
time (Robert et al., 1998).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, since the primary use of the Internet is communication,
some people might speculate that the Internet will have positive social
consequences in people’s everyday lives because it increases the
frequency and quality of interpersonal communications among people.
People with easy access to others would feel better connected and more
strongly supported by others, leading to happiness and engagement in
families, organizations, communities, and society more generally
(Nikolovska, 2007).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, on the other hand, the ease of electronic communication may lead to
weaker social ties, because people have less reason to leave their homes
and actually interact face to face with other people. The Internet
allows people to more easily work from their home, to form and sustain
friendships and even romantic attachments from their home, to bank from
their home, to vote and engage in political and social issue based
discussions with others (from home) (Nikolovska, 2007).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with watching television and using a home computer and the Internet
generally imply physical inactivity and limited face-to-face social
interaction. Some studies, including our own, have indicated that using
a home computer and the Internet can lead to increased skills and
confidence with computers (Lundmark, Kiesler, Kraut, Scherlis, &amp;amp;
Mukhopadhyay, 1998). However, when people use these technologies
intensively for learning new software, playing computer games, or
retrieving electronic information, they consume time and may spend more
time alone (Vitalari, Venkatesh, &amp;amp; Gronhaug, 1985). Some cross-sectional
research suggests that home computing may be displacing television
watching itself (Danko, W. D. &amp;amp; MacLachlan, J. M, 1983), (Kohut, 1994)
as well as reducing leisure time with the family (Vitalari et al.,
1985).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this variety of ways, Internet communications can potentially
displace face-to-face communications. This point is important because
psychologists in many researches have described and proved such face to
face and telephone connections as being of higher quality, when viewed
in terms of their contribution to satisfaction and
well-being(Nikolovska, 2007).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question that rise is while our culture heralds the Internet as a
technological wonder; there are suggestions that Internet use has a
negative influence on individuals and their social skills. A recent
study conducted by Carnegie Mellon University concludes that Internet
use leads to small but statistically significant increases in misery and
loneliness and a decline in overall psychological
well-being(Association, American Psychological, 1998). The appropriately
named HomeNetproject studied a sample of 169 people in Pittsburg during
their first year or two online. Data showed that as people in this
sample used the Internet more, they reported keeping up with fewer
friends. They also reported spending less time talking with their
families, experiencing more daily stress, and feeling more lonely and
depressed. These results occurred even though interpersonal
communication was their most important reason for using the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katz and Aspden’s national survey (1997) is one of the few empirical
studies that have compared the social participation of Internet users
with nonusers. Controlling statistically for education, race, and other
demographic variables, these researchers found no differences between
Internet users’ and nonusers’ memberships in religious, leisure, and
community organizations or in the amount of time users and nonusers
reported spending communicating with family and friends. From these
data, Katz and Aspden concluded that “[f]ar from creating a nation of
strangers, the Internet is creating a nation richer in friendships and
social relationships” (p. 86)(Robert et al., 1998).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the percentage of usage of the technology nowadays
drastically enhanced. Such as the state/country statistics of
information society reports during pass few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parallel between two countries with a similarity of population number:
Estonia and Macedonia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estonia since 2000 had 366,600 connected citizens though Internet.
However, in 2010 the statistic report’s the rapidly changes with the
number of 969,700 connections (Miniwatts Marketing Group., 2010). Yet
the statistic in Macedonia shows since 2000 the users that were
connected are 30,000, where in 2010 the number swiftly has change,
1,057,400 users in the country were connected though Internet. Thus, the
statistic shows that 75,1% of citizens in Estonia has access to
Internet, analogous to Macedonia 51% of population of the country in
final report of 2010 (Miniwatts Marketing Group, 2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, from the statistic we can see that, most of the population
nowadays has a computer, laptop, or device in their pocket that can
connect on Internet. Despite the alarm, research indicates most children
are doing fine. Computers are certainly intriguing and captivating, and
the Internet is most assuredly alluring with its research and
communicative capacities. But overall, technology can be considered a
positive enhancement to growth(Affonso, 1999). This feature is
eloquently affirmed by author Don Tapscott (Tapscott, 1999):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“… when kids are online, they’re reading, thinking, analyzing,
criticizing and authenticating – composing their thoughts. Kids use
computers for activities that go hand-in-hand with our understanding of
what constitutes a traditional childhood. They use the technology to
play, learn, communicate and form relationships as children always have.
Development is enhanced in an interactive world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above the influence of the Internet has caused a change in the
way we communicate, study, shop, etc. The most famous for the ability to
spread information, to communicate from a distance with a web camera,
etc. it is the Internet. But this communication revolution changed the
pure nature of interpersonal and group processes. We should be able to
see the difference between the qualities of face-to-face communication
that influence the impact of communication on people and their social
interaction. Moreover, should we be able to predict the probable
influence of any new communication technology. Nevertheless, the
researchers show that people sooner or later convert their cyber
contacts into more traditional face-to-face, as most of us do. People
use the Internet, in other words to help them achieve their real-life
goals. And rather than technology’s changing people’s social and
psychological reality, in other words, people change their use of
technology to facilitate their creation of a desired social reality.&lt;/p&gt;

the El Bulli Hacienda Hotel near Seville, Spain. The event’s title
expressed its key question: what will Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
be like in the year 2020? (Harper, Tom, Yvonne, &amp;amp; Abigail, 2008, p. 8)
The report that I have read it is divided in a four parts; Part 1 it is
look back over the past 20 years or so; Part 2 it gives an outline how
does changes are transforming the nature of our interaction with
computers and the key questions that need to be addressed in the next 15
years as a result; Part 3 is concerned with HCI as a field of research
and as a community of practitioners and designers; Part 4,
recommendations, outlines specific suggestions for HCI in terms of how
the field needs to be change. Therefore, the research report it talks
about the future aspects and the future plans with an recommendations
that has to be concern in an aspect of HCI, I have chosen to write about
the part 4 where they give a good outline of the recommendations that
has to be encounter for the new actions in the future of HCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research report came with very good seventh future directions. Each
direction will be described in an educationally signification for me,
what I have learned and what should be the next future actions in
consideration. Matter of course, no one will know in what kind of
aspects and future plans the HCI will change, but still this research
report gives vaulting and most important future recommendations that
need to be considered, and there will be more and more recommendations
and future directions as the technology and the HCI changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start to talk about the recommendations in a field of HCI,
let’s see what HCI is. It is a term used to refer to the understanding
and designing of different relationships between people and computers.
In the late 1970’s the main concern was usability. Since then, HCI has
established and designed, developed and apply all manners to ensure that
the technologies are easy to learn and easy to use. (Harper, Tom,
Yvonne, &amp;amp; Abigail, 2008, p. 84)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting familiar with the terms and the practice of HCI let as
look though the main seventh future recommendations that were considered
by the scholars and people involved in this forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 1: Revisit research and design methods in HCI: it is
    a distinct research area, methods and techniques have been used have
    altered over the years. Computer system and technologies are still
    in a way of changes, thus are the approaches for 2020 that needs to
    be considered:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore new ways of understanding users. Over the last decade there
    have been techniques and design-based practices involving cultural
    probes. Usage of existing techniques of understanding that have
    emerged from scientific and engineering traditions, designs, views
    of diverse disciplines and cultural traditions; usage of conceptual
    analysis in the first stage of new HCI, where can comes from
    techniques of analytic philosophy and clarifying the systems of
    meaning and value of actions that are involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore new ways of designing and making. Designing and making it
    takes a very important influence in a way of HCI. It is very
    important to comprehend for what, which and why the system is going
    to be used, what kind of users. In the future lightweight and
    prototypes should fit the designing and engineering solutions
    together. Should be developed new technological, prototype tool for
    the future development, and consider a test of hardware and software
    within every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reconsider how to evaluate digital technologies. Create a purpose of
    usage of the system, towards the, is it going to be used in everyday
    life in houses, working spaces or other environment. For what kind
    of usability the system is going to be used. For all should be made
    evaluation tools to reconsider the criteria and techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 2: Be explicit about the remit of HCI. How far or
    whether the HCI as a research area should continue extend itself, or
    should be involved with interaction between people and digital
    technology, and should with concern itself more than in the past?
    Does are the question that should be raised. It should develop new
    design possibilities, future altering and crafting the landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 3: Develop disciplinary techniques that allow HCI to
    collaborate with other research communities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disciplinary exchange. Requirement for HCI researchers to know how
    to converse with disciplines with very different traditions, they
    need to understand what philosophers can do and why philosophy is
    important. Example: economists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beyond interdisciplinary boundaries. HCI should ask what might be
    the appropriate models for allowing interdisciplinary investigations
    to happen and it is an area where investment in research theories
    and approaches, in the elements of HCI competence and skill, and in
    the foundations of the philosophy of science are required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 4: Teach HCI to the young. Children should be
    introduced to the ‘properties and possibilities of computing’ it is
    the only way that they develop sufficient understanding of computing
    to enable them to be fully computer-literate when they are adults,
    and help them to shape the world in relation to technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 5: More advanced training for future HCI researchers.
    HCI professionals need to move outside of the scientific community
    they have lived within and find ways to engage with society as a
    whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 6: Engage with government, policy and society. More
    better technical and economical approach, where there will be wide
    range of implementing HCI in a government, but in policy and
    society. HCI should have a strong links with the society, it needs
    to interact more, not only like for policy in a trust and security
    in computer systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 7: Offer an inclusive future in 2020. By 2020, HCI
    will need to be able to design for and support differences in human
    value, irrespective of the economic means of those seeking those
    values. In this way, the future can be different and diverse because
    people want it to be. (Harper, Tom, Yvonne, &amp;amp; Abigail, 2008, pp.
    78-83)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this article very interesting, not only in an aspect of human
interaction with computers but with the actions that were taken and the
propositions that were sum. I love to make a summer of the entire
research paper, but because of the short time period I could not make
it. Still I gained my knowledge what should be expected and where are
burrows in HCI field. It gives me a perfect view for the future
implementation of projects, aspects and techniques that can be used.
Hope that this few years since the 2007, the implementation and
recommendation directories have been successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the responsibilities
for the IP addresses below and how we can make connection to them. IP
addresses are randomly chosen by the lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IP addresses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. 69.163.171.238&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. 31.44.184.101&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. 188.72.228.69 …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;PURPOSE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the responsibilities
for the IP addresses below and how we can make connection to them. IP
addresses are randomly chosen by the lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IP addresses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. 69.163.171.238&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. 31.44.184.101&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. 188.72.228.69&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External IP that is used for purpose of this test is following:
193.40.244.0/255 1. The ISP that provides this network is EENet2.
Organization that is behind is Tallinn Technical University, Estonia.
City location is Tallinn and the region is Harjumaa. The phone number of
my ISP is: +372 73&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;*&lt;/em&gt;. The e-mail we should report abuse are: first
persons that is in charge: Viktor Borisevitch (e-mail:&lt;/strong&gt;tor at cc.ttu.ee
and phone number: +372-2-&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;*46) and Andres Lepp (e-mail: l&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at
cc.ttu.ee and phone number: +372 6 &lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;55). In addition, if we wont to
submit an abuse we should use both persons of network administration and
then we can submit and security incident on the following ISP e-mail:
turvas@eeenet.ee [RIPE NCC].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, Method 1 and Appendix 1 describes the website, tools and
application that are used to conduct this laboratory report. In
addition, Method 2 and Appendix 2 will introduce website tools and
databases where we can check if following IP’s have been reported before
as abuse and security risk. Both methods are represented with answer and
consequences confront in the result section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the conclusion made of all collected data will be concise in
conclusion section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;METHODS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First method describes and demonstrates web tools that have been used to
collect the needed information from the stated IP’s addresses. Second
method is pointing out website tools and databases that can be applied
if the IP has been reported previously as a abuse, spam or security
threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we need to collect as much as we can details about the IP
address. In Appendix 1 is showing the wholly information of the IP’s,
contact details, organization name, address, location, state, country,
technicians contact, abuse phone number, abuse e-mail, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the location of IP we should make sure that not only we
know the ISP or abuse contact details, but we should know national CERT
3 agency that is in charge too. Therefore, to collect the information we
have used different web sites, agencies: [RIPENCC, LACNIC, AfriNIC,
APNIC, ARIN]. The above reference are agencies collected from IANA4.
Authority responsible for global coordination of the Internet Protocol
addressing systems [IANA].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to have more details about the route of the IP’s we are using
command prompt in Windows 7 with the following command, where the
results are presented in Appendix 2 section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    tracert [0.0.0.0]To illustrate, the details information are presented in Result 1 section.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we have collected the wholly information about the concrete IP
proposals, we should check if in addition those IP’s previously have
been reported as abused, spam or security threat. To complete the
following method we need to check concrete database system that is
offering following service. First that crossed on web is [MalwareURL]
which is dedicated to fighting malware, trojans and a multitude of other
web-related threats. In addition, we can check if the IP addresses are
listed in anti-spam databases. With other words blacklist check
[MyIPAddress].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results from Method 1 are presented in Result 1, further Method 2 is
presented in Result 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;RESULT 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each IP are presented only the most important data details that we
need to collect for our goal. In addition, full description and details
are presented in Appendix 1. The tables bellow are illustrating the most
important information that we should look-for. In addition, the
highlighted lines are indicating the abuse e-mail box that should be
send mail too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    69.163.171.238OrgName: New Dream Network, LLCAddress: 417 Associated Rd.Address: PMB #257City: BreaStateProv: CAPostalCode: 92821Country: US#technician in chargeOrgTechName: Nagel, MarkOrgTechPhone: +1-714-706-4182OrgTechEmail: mna47-arin at dreamhost.com#abuse in chargeOrgAbuseName: DreamHost Abuse TeamOrgAbusePhone: +1-714-706-4182OrgAbuseEmail: abuse&amp;nbsp; at dreamhost.comTable 131.44.184.101person: Chris Burnsaddress: Building 4&gt;address: City West Office Parkaddress: Gelderd Roadaddress: Leeds LS12 6LXaddress: Englandphone: +44-208-901-2332#abuse e-mail: abuse-mailbox: abuse at laveconetworks.co.ukTable 288.72.228.69role: Mannesmann Arcor Network Operation Centeraddress: Arcor AG &amp;amp; Co.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, now that we know the abuse e-mail, phone number and contact
person details, still is this information enough for us. If we look in
details all of the IP’s are from different countries. Therefore we need
to find what is the national CERT agency contact details. First table is
based in USA, therefore we need to use their reporting system, which is
locate in the following link: &lt;a href="http://www.us-cert.gov/"&gt;http://www.us-cert.gov/&lt;/a&gt; . Second table
is UK, the national CERT agency link:
&lt;a href="http://www.ukcert.org.uk/"&gt;www.ukcert.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. Third table is based in
Germany, the CERT agency link: &lt;a href="http://www.cert-verbund.de/"&gt;http://www.cert-verbund.de/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the routing trace we can conclude that the first IP and the third
respond and it did not miss route trace, where in the second IP,
31.44.184.101 there is miss route trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we will run this IP address to Method 2. Despite the fact,
still we will run the rest of IP’s in the Method 2, to be trusted that
are not in the abuse list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;RESULT 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step is to attempt to search the IP address to check if they have
been previously report as a abuse, trojan, malware, security threat,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check and verify the security status we are using the service
available [MalwareURL]. Where results for 69.163.171.238 and
88.72.228.69 are with status that have not been previously reported as
abuse. On the other hand, 31.44.184.101 IP address is detected as an
security threat before. More details are presented in Appendix 3. Where
is demonstrating that the
&lt;code&gt;/404.php?type=stats&amp;amp;amp;affid=531&amp;amp;amp;subid=03&amp;amp;amp;iruns&lt;/code&gt; has been
reported as malicious URL and it is in a blacklist of Google, MyWOT,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that it is listed in the malware database list, but also if we
double check on service [MyIPAddress] that the 31.44.184.101 IP address
is listed in few blacklist which is assess by DNSBL5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that the concrete IP’s that we
analysis in this report are demonstrating the process and methods that
should be done in future to detect, report abuse, malware, threat,
trojan, security risk, etc. Where we should gather the detail
information, and to whom to turn the abuse. To be precise that are not
in blacklist, spam list, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of following IP’s: 69.163.171.238 and 88.72.228.69, from
performing methods and delivering results are safe and secure, still
think can be exploited in easy manners. The opposite, IP address
31.44.184.101 it has been already report infected as malicious code from
few blacklist providers. When checking the DNS, host name is linking to
UK company that deals with IP Transit. For further information please
check the following link: &lt;a href="http://www.laveconetworks.co.uk/"&gt;http://www.laveconetworks.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, hope that laboratory report and the analyse will help to
anyone else to guide them for future use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIXES&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1 is list of details collected from service. Appendix 2 is
trace route details. Where Appendix 3 is the result collected from the
black list database.&lt;/p&gt;
