assessment. Please bear in mind, that the author is conducting research
in this field, therefore in few months there will be more articles about
cyber-risk and so forth. Nevertheless, hope that the below will guide
you, and will give you better understanding for risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet has become as essential part of risks in every organization.
Despite all the malicious code and alerts, we use it increasingly.
Therefore, risk assessment is a critical part of risk management in each
organization that deals within the IT infrastructure. Traditionally, the
focus has been related to natural hazards. However, risk assessment has
received much attention in the past decade. Subsequently it is a primary
task in enterprises and it is widely considered a key reason for
improving an organization’s IT performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In content to risk assessment as a part of risk management, additionally
we have the criminality and unlawful exploitations of the Internet.
Accordingly, [1] provides a partial approach to cyber-risk as a vital
feature of risk assessment. Consequently, there are three different
approaches that the studies have tended to focus on, such as, economical
approach [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], cyber-risk coupled with risk management
and insurance [1, 9, 10], and game theory [11, 6, 7]. Moreover, we
define risk when the chosen action or activity will lead to
organizational loss. In addition, risk is the likelihood that something
wrong or/and bad will happen and it will cause harm to the
organizational information asset, or lead to the entire loss of the
asset. In risk, vulnerability is a weakness that could be used to
jeopardize or cause harm. Threat is anything (artificial or act of
nature) that has the potential to cause harm to organizational
information assets [11].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the chance that a threat will use a vulnerability to cause damage
creates a risk for the organizations. When a threat uses vulnerability
to inflict damage, it has an impact. In the context of information
security, the impact is a loss of availability, integrity and
confidentiality. Similarly, to information security, in cyber security
the additional impacts are: non-repudiation, authentication, information
systems importance and criticality according to state Critical
Information Infrastructure / Critical Infrastructure. Other possible
losses can occur too, such as loss of income and loss of life, etc. It
is very important to point out that it is impossible to find all risks,
nor is it possible to drop all risks [12].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

approaches to risk assessment. Additionally for further readings, we
