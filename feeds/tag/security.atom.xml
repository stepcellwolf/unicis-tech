Drinking beer and giving presentation why Drupal for me is a winner when it comes in CMS (Content Management System) security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used WordPress for several years, however soon as I got introduced to Drupal from my earlier colleague and a good friend I started to love it. It took me a several week to get to know the way how Drupal works, and the modules = plugins, views, content, etc. Soon as I've seen how easy is the setup, management and maintenance I felt in love from the first sight. Since then I will never switch to anther dynamic CMS solution unless is a static one, such as Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway sorry for any inconvenience but the video is available only in Macedonian language. However the presentation (html) format in the archive file below is in English version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to give any comments below or suggestions to improve the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, what made the December special month for Belgrade is that the Philosophical Theater (Drama) hosted the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Berardi"&gt;Franco “Bifo” Berardi&lt;/a&gt; on 1th December at &lt;a href="http://www.narodnopozoriste.rs/en/--not-5169-9255-1299-2308"&gt;National Theatre in Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;. I was invited by a friend of mine to attend the discussion with one of the most known philosopher from Italy, and indeed I enjoyed a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bifo - Belgrade" src="https://scontent-frt3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/12346300_10153864400614575_6689430077986305516_n.jpg?oh=b44028c36e0f36a4769ca692d7d730a9&amp;amp;oe=56EB8EE9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I will try to highlight only the discussion in the field of cyber culture and digital divide that was reflected, and not going too much in details about the philosophy and so on. The discussion began within the reading notes from the “&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/After-Future-Franco-Bifo-Berardi/dp/1849350590"&gt;After the Future&lt;/a&gt;” book where Bifo reflected on the cyber culture by putting the emphasis that we must stop working due to the fact that  we have been working for the past 300-3000 years. In the background there was a song from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgcc5V9Hu3g"&gt;David Bowie – Heroes&lt;/a&gt; which made the discussion much fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Bifo also share an example of well-known social networking platform Twitter where the main and initial idea was to be an activist platform, rather what is now, and in the end soon was taken over from a big venture capitalist. In some view I might conclude that Bifo it might be a technophobe who is afraid of new technologies, however in the end he is positive and optimistic man. Furthermore, he talked a bit about the Julian Assange and Edward Snowden example, as well of hacktivist &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz"&gt;Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt;. Then, he noted the symptom of hard side of advertising and how to make conspicuous and distinguishing the distances between body versus voice, as Thom Yorke has expressed his vision of a society, where people are increasingly more obsessed with pointless technology, selfishness and mindless entertainment than life itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="National Theatre in Belgrade" src="https://scontent-frt3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfl1/v/t1.0-9/12341197_10153847782034575_2115013709091603844_n.jpg?oh=0e889d9f582e5beca4fbabc44fd77731&amp;amp;oe=56E5ECA2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something what made me curious is his view of terrorism and terrorists attacks today, where he mentioned that they are not due to the fact of killing someone or have something regarding religion, but in fact the main goal is to kill themselves. Questions were fruitful and he gave indeed philosophical answers, such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenitism"&gt;Zenitism&lt;/a&gt; as an art movement in Yugoslavia. Further than about UN or different organization what is his view where he noted that the problem between society and politics are in fact relations, where male politicians governs the females – emphasizing that democracy is dead even after the elections or so on. Another question was about view of artificial intelligence how does he see it as a threat or killing the modern capitalism and he shared a positive view by highlighting that the world is smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, after two hours and a half discussion, it was a pleasure to be there and see different views of cyber culture and digital divide opinions. Definitely it made me to over think my thoughts for sure, and at the same time to have a different opinion and to change my view of technology. However, I'm not sure yet what it is? Therefore, I will continue to search for the right answer and draw a map between security and privacy, which unfortunately in end was not discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="pages"></category><category term="Balkan"></category><category term="digital devide"></category><category term="IoT"></category><category term="philosophy"></category><category term="Bifo"></category><category term="Franco Berardi"></category><category term="hacktivist"></category><category term="cyber"></category><category term="future"></category><category term="artificial intelligence"></category><category term="zenitism"></category><category term="policy"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>Secrets for eavesdropping - respublica.edu.mk</title><link href="https://predragtasevski.com/posts/2015/10/eavesdropping-secrets/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-10-19T18:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2015-10-19T18:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Predrag TASEVSKI - Pece</name></author><id>tag:predragtasevski.com,2015-10-19:/posts/2015/10/eavesdropping-secrets/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In September I have joined the academic team for writing a blog about public interest topics and actual situation in Macedonia - &lt;a href="http://respublica.edu.mk/" title="Respublica Academic Blog"&gt;ResPublica&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Information and communication technologies in Macedonia have experienced a phenomenal growth throughout the last decades, which has had a tremendous impact on governmental services’ presence in the Internet, as well as on everyday life. Against this background, technologies-based growth introduces new risks and threats to the cyber domain in the country. To respond to those challenges the Macedonian government is pursing the establishment of a national authority to react to cyber attacks that occur, or a Computer Incident Response Team – MKD-CIRT, and the adoption of a National Cybersecurity Strategy. However, it should be
taken into account that such tasks are neither easy nor simple. There are several issues that should be considered, for instance: the improvement of the measures for protection of information systems and of the critical infrastructure; the legal and policy framework; the international approach; and the formation of a cybersecurity culture, to name but a few. Simultaneously, considering that Macedonia is a candidate for accession to the EU and NATO, it has to comply with their standards when performing the reforms in the cybersecurity field. The current article briefly introduces the country’s steps towards cybersecurity, provides an analysis of the legal, policy and institutional progress achieved, and suggests recommendations that should be considered to ensure safer, secure, trustworthy and resilient cyber space
in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few days, months and indeed years many people have
approached me and asked me a very simple question… But bare in mind that
this simple question was and indeed it is a still a big dilemma between
many professionals in IT security, cyber security, management,
decision-makers, policy, etc.  Thereby, the question is: What is the
difference between Penetration testing and Vulnerability Assessment? And
of course this question was almost always couples with the question if
we do penetration testing does it means that we are doing as well as
vulnerability assessment? In this content, I have decided to share with
you the meanings, such as, methods, approaches of each process, as well
as a further reading – papers, articles and books – that could help you
to distinguish this difference and of course broaden your views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no further do, firstly I would like to make sure that we are clear
with the empirical terminologies used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerability Assessment&lt;/strong&gt; is the process of identifying,
    quantifying, and prioritizing (or ranking) the vulnerabilities in a
    system &lt;a href="[&amp;quot;Vulnerability"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Penetration Testing&lt;/strong&gt; - occasionally &lt;strong&gt;pentest&lt;/strong&gt;, is a method of
    evaluating computer and network security by simulating an attack on
    a computer system or network from external and internal threats &lt;a href=""&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, the above two terms are confused with each other. In other
words, penetration testing is necessary to determine the true attack
footprint of your environment, assets, and so fort. For this reason the
the difference is highlighted and fully explained below in separated
sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Vulnerability Assessments&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is used and of course it is necessary to discovering potential
vulnerabilities throughout the environment in for instance,
organization, company, or even asset. Usually there different scope for
such an task, nonetheless sometimes does work only by available
automatic tools or through manual test as well. Usually, and please bare
this in your mind that full exploitation of systems and services is not
generally in scope for a normal vulnerability assessment task.
Most-likely, systems are typically enumerated and evaluated for
vulnerabilities and testing can be done with or without authentication.
Additionally, important in fact for the management staff is the
actionable reports, thus reports contain details about the mitigation
strategies, for instance, applying missing patches, correcting insecure
system configurations and among the others [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steps to vulnerability assessments are [4]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cataloging assets and resources in a system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assigning quantifiable value and importance to the resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying the vulnerabilities or potential threats to each
    resource&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And mitigating or eliminating the most serious vulnerabilities for
    the most valuable resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Penetration testing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pen testing is coupled, or in other words it expands upon vulnerability
assessment efforts by introducing exploitation into the matrix. The main
purpose is to allow the business to understand if the mitigation
strategies are actually working as it was expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, pen testing requires a higher skill level than is needed
for vulnerability analysis. Particularly, this means that the price for
penetration test will be much higher than that of a vulnerability
analysis [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, there are two primary types of pen tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White box, it uses vulnerability assessment and other predisclosed
    information, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black box, it performed with very little knowledge of the target
    systems and it is left to the tester to perform their own
    reconnaissance, to gather information as much as possible..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, pen tests follow these steps [4]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determination of scope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeted information gathering or reconnaissance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploit attempts for access and escalation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensitive data collection testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean up and final reporting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key difference between those two is that pen testing goes beyond the
level of identifying vulnerabilities and goes through the process of
exploitation, privilege escalation, and maintaining access to the target
system. Where on the other hand, vulnerability assessment provides a
better picture of any existing flaws in the system with out the
measuring the impact of the flaws to the system. However, vulnerability
assessment carefully identifies and quantifies all the vulnerabilities
in a non-invasive manner [5].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

administration of Belgrade Security Forum, within goal of inviting me to
be a speaker in one of the break out sessions. In particular the session
topic is: &lt;strong&gt;Assuring Cyber-Security in the Western Balkans and the Rest
of Europe.&lt;/strong&gt; And of course, I have accepted the invitation. Speak of
which, the &lt;em&gt;Belgrade Security Forum&lt;/em&gt; has been in past few years. This –
2013 year was the third in the row event. And with it, we have continue
the talk from the previous year session about cyber security: &lt;a href="http://2012.belgradeforum.org/agenda/session3.html%20&amp;quot;Belgrade%20Security%20Forum%202012"&gt;Cyber War
and Cyber Crime: Responding to the Governance
Challenges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to this year session, we had a very good chance to boost the
enthusiasm from other panel discussion where chairman – Richard Thomson
called me in between the discussion of Helsinki Plus 40: Strengthening
the Security Community to Meet Current Security Challenges. Where he
raise the issue of what and if it is possible with one click that
someone could stop the energy, power supply or even telecommunication
systems. And, my answer was very straightforward, indeed it is! This was
a very good spur of inspiration of our breakout session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with other speaker we came to conclusion that the best way to
go ahead and to have an effective discussion is to open the most
important questions relating to cyber security: &lt;strong&gt;Who? What? and How?&lt;/strong&gt;
But before further to the answers the above question, I would like also
to mention that the speakers where kind of divided, in a good sense
where we came from different regions as well as specialized fields in
cyber security. In details, &lt;strong&gt;Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones&lt;/strong&gt; was in
related fields in government issues and challenges in cyber security.
Where on other hand, I was a representative from the Wester Balkan
region representative. Furthermore, &lt;strong&gt;Alexander Klimburg&lt;/strong&gt; was more
concentrating of different stakeholder, in other words multi
stakeholders approach. Where last but not least, &lt;strong&gt;Jovan Kurbalija&lt;/strong&gt; was
in diplomacy, civil society and information technology. And finally, the
moderator of the session was &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Radunović&lt;/strong&gt;, who manage to
create a nice vibe between the speakers and the audience from the
beginning until the end of the session. For more details of the session
please follow the Breakout session report: &lt;a href="http://belgradeforum.org/info/news/459/Session+7%3A+Assuring+Cyber-Security+in+the+Western+Balkans+and+the+Rest+of+Europe.html" title="Session 7: Assuring Cyber-Security in the Western Balkans and the Rest of Europe"&gt;Session 7: Assuring
Cyber-Security in the Western Balkans and the Rest of
Europe&lt;/a&gt;.
For more information of the issues that we follow and given answers are
available on the
&lt;a href="http://www.belgradeforum.org/agenda/sesija5.html" title="Agenda"&gt;Agenda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From left to right: Vladimir Radunović, Predrag Tasevski, Jovan
Kurbalija, Alexander Klimburg and Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I would like to make some quick notes on the main cyber threats and
possible effects that are linked to Western Balkan region. The most
known and presented cyber threats are among the cybercrime. For instance
in one hand are: employee fraud, minor and child pornography; using of
mobile telephones and smartphones as tools to commit other crime;
identity theft and credit card fraud. Where on the other hand are among
the political, moral, ethical and other motivation reasons. Such as,
web-based attacks, mostly committed by defacement or denial-of-service
attacks. Then we have phising and spoofing social networking sites.
Where the possible effects are for instance for individuals loss of
money, and of course political or ethical doctrine. Moreover, awareness
of roles and responsibilities of different actors, such as government,
regulators, industry and civil society of risk are taken into
consideration only the implementation of law. For instance, data
protection law and so on. Turning to the industry and civil society is
almost the same, although some of them are implementing the very known
standards, such as ISO 27001 and so on. However, is this enough? The
roles and responsibilities are only described in the data protection law
and criminal law. Unfortunately, it is not carried out by the framework
or even a strategy. Likelihood, awareness level in Western Balkans
presented by my paper back book that I have conducted last year,
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Cyber-Security-Awareness-Program/dp/3659207985/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1367779682&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=Interactive+Cyber+Security+Awareness+Program" title="Interactive Cyber Security Awareness Program"&gt;Interactive Cyber Security Awareness Program Cyber Security Awareness
Program&lt;/a&gt;.
This book outlines the survey done around 1000 participants, from 11 to
63 years old. In diversity of carries, such as schools, universities,
private and public organizations. In total we had 35% people using
computers/internet from home and 26% from office. In particular and most
interesting figures for us are results about the knowledge of protecting
their IT assets, and in details: 16% are very knowledgeable, least
knowledgeable are 13% and last but not least somewhat knowledgeable are
40%. Therefore from the results presented we can see that awareness
level among the end users is vary. Coming to the end, if we want to make
sure the involvement of end users in raising trust and securing the
cyberspace we firstly have to start from strategy, than legal framework,
followed by implementation, and so on. However, when it comes to step to
get done by governments should be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and create strategy framework for Cyber-security, in
    particular, not to cover the area only of cyber crime, but also how
    to mitigate happened incidents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewrite and review the cyber crime law and data protection law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create NGO or NPO that will deal not only for a concrete country but
    of course the entire region, as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I have noted that some countries in Wester Balkans do not
have &lt;strong&gt;yet&lt;/strong&gt; either, CERT – Critical Emergency Response Team nor CIRT –
Critical Incident Response Team. Therefore, this action should be taken
as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, hope that the above notes will take effect, as well as will
raise the awareness of the important in fact issue. Therefore we have to
be simple and follow just simple three steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategical plan which will aim in business continuity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partnership between Groups, such as government, private and civil.
    As well as to provide awareness on the share bases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education the public, where we need to take an action of
    re-informing the school materials, and to provide the young
    generations guide of how to protect in cyber space and skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the participant, speakers, guest, organizers and everyone
for such a lovely stay in Belgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

by &lt;a href="http://www.paneuropa.bg/" title="PanEuropa Bulgaria"&gt;PanEuropa Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; and
it was supported by NATO. Furthermore, I was invited to take a
participation as a speaker on the panel discussion Collective Cyber
Defence – The Role of Newer Members and Opportunities for Specialization
of Bulgaria in the Alliance Questions and answers. In details, the event
main points ware to highlight the need for specialization of each member
state in terms of the principles of Smart Defense and the joint
participation in future military operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the event had splendid video addressing in the opening session
of Neelie Kroes, the Vice – President of European Commission.
Emphasizing the current online spying crisis as well as the importance
of cyber security strategy. In additional, she highlighted the
importance of new legal threats, information norms coupled to boost the
trust among the Europe. As well as, that the weakest link in the chain
should be able to raise and boost the awareness, coupled with the future
investments in research and innovations, and projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the collective cyber defense panel discussion, I was delighted
to be speaker with such strong extensive and experienced experts from
different fields. Such as private, public, academy and business sectors.
Speaking of which, the moderator of the panel was Prof. Veselin Tselkov,
D. Sc., Member of the Board, Commission for Personal Data Protection in
Bulgaria. The lectures where: unfortunately Col. Associate Prof. Dr.
Stoyan Balabanov, Director, Institute for Defense, Ministry of Defense
Bulgaria, was not able to attend the panel, however we had
representative from MoD. Also from Bulgaria was Zlatogor Minchev from
Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Bulgaria. From
Macedonian was Dr. Metodi Hadji-Janev (LtC), Assistant Prof., Military
Academy ” General Mihailo Apostolski”, Skopje, Macedonia. From business
prospective I was the presenter of
&lt;a href="http://cybersecurity.mk" title="CyberSecurity.mk"&gt;CyberSecurity.mk&lt;/a&gt; copmany,
based in Macedonia. In addition, Mr. Robert Griffin, Director Business
Development – Security Systems, RSA. From all the above, we also had
video addressing from Mr. Detlef Puhl, Senior Advisor at the Emerging
Security Challenges Division, NATO Headquarters, and Mr. Philippe
Roggeband, Security Sales Business Development Manager, EBG EMEAR, Cisco
Systems. However, due to the security measures in the building where the
event was held the video addressing was interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, here is my short presentation notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberspace has become one of the most essential and distinguished
bridge between government and their inhabitants. Thus, the people are
able to get access to government services 24/7, as well as their life
becomes more easier. However, all in this has led to advance of
producing cyberspace to be vulnerable, coupled with information’s that
should not be available to others. For this reason I would like to
share three important points that are fundamental to emphasis when we
discuss about the Cyber defense in general. First, we have to
understand and highlight the difference between Cyber Security vs IT
Security. Second, it is the important to boost the awareness level
tailored to national level, social society, private sector and indeed
multistakeholder cooperation in the region. Last but not least, we
have to brake the lack of communications between the neighboring
countries and to create a trusted, same level, and collaboration of
cyber security. Where national agencies and parties should work
together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, first the main goal of IT security is to protect
information from a wide range of threats in order to ensure business
continuity, reduce business damages and maximize return on investments
and business opportunity. Likewise the cyber security is protecting
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) systems and Critical
Infrastructure (CI). However the most important protection element in
IT security is to reduce business risk to accepted levels and the
protection of entire information and information systems essential to
the organizations. Alternatively, cyber security aims at assuring
critical IT service for CI and CII on accepted levels, in addition to
the protection of critical information. In other words the security
objective determiner in information security is an organization’s
business process, while in cyber security it is for the entire state.
Emphasizing that states may have different or complementary interests
compared to an organization’s business interests. On one hand,
handling cyber security problems is considered to be both a nationally
and internationally coordinated activity to protect national CII.
Similarly, to information security goals: confidentiality,
availability and integrity, in cyber security the additional goals are
non-repudiation, authentication, information systems importance and
criticality from the standpoint of state CII/CI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to awareness, I would like to share my recent research that
have been published as book, title: Interactive Cyber Security
Awareness Program. It is highlighting the method, approach and the
importance of current awareness level in Western Balkans. Coupled how
to boost the awareness on the national level. I would not like to go
in details, however, just want to mention that the positive results
were presented, and that the awareness level among the end users are
varied. Moreover, in particular we have to create and recognize the
importance of establishing cyber security awareness strategy, coupled
with influence of the weakest link in cyber security, which is the
human factor, or in other words, social-technical aspects. In spite of
our investment in technologies and in the applications, still the
weakest link in cyber defense and security will the human behavior.
Therefore, we will have to conceive an awareness/education to raise
the awareness on the national behalf, such as, from the young to the
oldest generation, tailored through social society, private sector and
multistakeholder cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, in recent years we are witnesses of acts that have taken into
place between neighboring countries in the region. Such acts were
followed by different motivations of attacks. Where mostly they were
done through defacement’s or denial-of-service attacks. Thus,
motivations where divers. Nevertheless, in this last point is I would
like to stress the importance of merging the best practices learned
from past event occurrence as well as to improve the role of newer
members and opportunities into the collective roles of cyber defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, I am keen that after this discussion/panel will lead into
further actions. And also thanks to the organizers for the invitation
and done a good job in organizing such an important event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A toolkit is a collection of tools, where for our motives is an assembly
of tools to eavesdropper and scan network security for the possible
exploitations. Moreover, these tools are designed from security
researchers and experts, for the purpose of network administrator and
security analysts to be able in everyday work to conduct potential
exploitations, to watch and to analyse the network. Additionally,
network monitoring is a term to describe the system that is constantly
monitoring computer network for being slow or failing peripherals, and
it notifies the network administrator either via email, SMS or alarms in
case of interruption of service. Equally to network monitoring, the
security analysts are responsible for designing and monitoring security
systems. As well as, to coordinating policies of security measures to
protect information in computer files from unauthorized or accidental
change, distribution or disclosure. It is therefore in this article we
will introduce the readers with the basic concept and essential part of
network security toolkits. As well as, already possible network security
tools to help them to conduct network security monitoring and analysing.
Lastly, we will give the readers with recommendation and conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Network Security Toolkit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section we will take a look at a few essential components of the
toolkits, and their main goals and purposes. When we assemble the
toolkit, you might want to consider having at least one of the following
components included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packet Sniffer&lt;/strong&gt;. It is an either software or hardware piece that
can intercept and log traffic passing over the network or part over the
network. As the data flaws across the network, the sniffer is capturing
each packets and if needed it will decode the packets raw, by displaying
the values of various fields in the packet, and it will analyse the
content according the RFC or other specifications. This is especially
useful when dealing with security threats that produce abnormal packets
or enormous traffic. As well as, it will help to diagnose failed network
hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Port Scanner&lt;/strong&gt;. It is software developed to probe server or host for
open ports. This kind of tools are essentially in every day work for
administrators to verify security policies of their network and to find
unwanted running services, before the attackers. They are very useful in
fact to figure and detect unauthorized systems and services. The
technique that most of the tools that are using are based upon finger
print matching technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intrusion Detection System (IDS)&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. It is a device
or application that monitors network or systems activities for malicious
hustle or policy violations and, of course produces reports to a
management staff. Moreover, typically they record information related to
observed events, let know the security administrators of observed
events, and respond to the detected threats by attempting to prevent it
from fulfil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;*Log Analysers&lt;/strong&gt;. Are dealing with large volume of
computer generated log messages, known as event logs, audit records,
etc. Furthermore, it deals as well as log analysis which can be in a
real-time and in bulk after storage, also log search and last procedure
reporting. In mace cases most of the system administrators groan of
examining through log files for precious of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Vulnerability Scanners&lt;strong&gt;. It is an application designed
to assess computers, application, computer systems and networks for
their weaknesses. There different types of vulnerability scanners by
distinguished from one another by a focusing to particular targets. The
functionality varies among the different types of vulnerability
scanners. They share common purpose of enumerating the vulnerabilities
present in one or more targets. Also they enable you to seek out if your
network or system has known vulnerabilities for patching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Web Scanners&lt;strong&gt;. It is a program which communicates with
web applications through the web front-end to be able to show potential
security vulnerabilities in the web application and their architectural
weaknesses. Unlike the source code scanners, web application scanners
they don’t have access to the source code, and that is why they detect
vulnerability by performing real attacks to the web application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Password Crackers**. It is a process of either recovering
or gaining access, password from data that has been stored in or
transmitted by a computer or network. The approach is to repeatedly
trying to guess the password. As well as, they allow you to quickly scan
a host computer for accounts with weak password, one or the other by
disabling them or force their owners to carry out and create stronger
passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the above list is just an understandable part that you should
have in mind to consider had them into your everyday network security
toolkit box. In the next paragraph we will give the readers with the
available tools that are essential for the network security toolkits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Available Network Security Tool&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the tools listed below are open source solutions and they cover
one or more components from the above list. Additionally, for further
detail information please refer to the following link
&lt;a href="http://sectools.org/"&gt;http://sectools.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance for password cracking you might use the &lt;a href="http://www.openwall.com/john/"&gt;John the
Ripper&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://project-rainbowcrack.com/"&gt;RainbowCrack&lt;/a&gt; tools. Where for packet
sniffing there is a big variety of tools, but most commonly known are:
&lt;a href="http://www.wireshark.org/"&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ntop.org/"&gt;Ntop&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/"&gt;Tcpdump&lt;/a&gt; and many others. Moreover, to be able
to conduct vulnerability scanning consider the following tools, such as,
&lt;a href="http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus"&gt;Nessus&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.openvas.org/"&gt;OpenVAS&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://www.titania-security.com"&gt;Nipper&lt;/a&gt;, etc. In addition to the
scanners, for web application the most known is a&lt;a href="http://www.portswigger.net/burp/"&gt;Burp
Suite&lt;/a&gt;, then
&lt;a href="http://www.websecurify.com/"&gt;Websecurify&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://cirt.net/nikto2"&gt;Nikto&lt;/a&gt; and few more. For port scan you might
want to consider &lt;a href="http://nmap.org/"&gt;Nmap&lt;/a&gt;. And finally for log analyser
to come in handy is &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/swatch/"&gt;Swatch&lt;/a&gt;,
as well as for Intrusion Detection System handy tool is
&lt;a href="http://www.snort.org/"&gt;Snort&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above list of tools and the list of components will help and aim to
the reader for what to have and to look at. Same as there are few of the
many pieces of software put together from the dedicated security experts
to advance the state of art of network security toolkit, such as,
&lt;a href="http://networksecuritytoolkit.org/nst/index.html"&gt;Network Security
Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; (NST)
bootable CD/DVD, &lt;a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/"&gt;BackTrack&lt;/a&gt; and many
others.&lt;/p&gt;

contains 89 malware files. The way how we choice 3 files is by following
algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soft them by name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First use last number of your student code + your birthday day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, generate random number from &lt;a href="http://www.random.org/"&gt;http://www.random.org/&lt;/a&gt; and
    only if it does not match first number use it for choosing the file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, use random number generator again and if it does not match
    first or second number use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malware archive can be download from the following link: [unfortunatly
not available anymore]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WARNING FILE CONTAINS LIVE VIRUSES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Task that need to be complete for this laboratory assignment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick your malware&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run your malware against 2 of next online analysis tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find additional 2 online analysis tools where to analyse virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that should be presented in the laboratory report are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chosen numbers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General information about malware&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;link to disinfecting instructions – if not possible explanation why it
is not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis tools – links&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your opinion about each analysis tool and comparison results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we are going to analyse the chosen files in section Chosen
files and each file with the above required information and detail
analysis results, links to disinfecting instructions, analysis tools
used for this purpose. Secondary, expression about each analysis tool
used and comparison results will be presented in section Analysis. In
addition, in section Appendixes its provides what virtual environment
has been used for this laboratory report. Because we know that if we
open this file in our real machine we will get infected. That is why we
are using an Linux virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, each file will be analysed with two different tools, in
case to gather more information and solution for disinfecting process.
Finally the conclusion made of all collected data will be concise in
conclusion section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CHOSEN FILES&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of files are listed bellow and the name of the file that is going
to be analysed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Number: 71; File name: &lt;code&gt;sales.exe; Size: 454.7 KB&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Number: 57; File name: &lt;code&gt;mgre.exe; Size: 61.4 KB&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above malware file has been reported that is capable to send out
e-mail message with the built in SMTP client engine. Second, it contains
characteristics of Waledac, a worm that spreads by sending an e-mail
containing links to copies of itself. And finally, creates a startup
registry entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links provided, are demonstrating which anti virus software/application
can disinfected the malware infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools for analysing the malware are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Netscty – Online Sandbox: &lt;a href="http://netscty.com/malware-tool"&gt;http://netscty.com/malware-tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;FILE 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;File name: &lt;code&gt;mgre.exe; Size: 61.4 KB;&lt;/code&gt; Number: 57.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links to analyse report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1.
&lt;a href="http://camas.comodo.com/cgi-bin/submit?%20file=89294d70e80547aac5b506915d2e8fc0309c0e578ab16fc9875c9a4668e63709"&gt;http://camas.comodo.com/cgi-bin/submit?file=89294d70e80547aac5b506915d2e8fc0309c0e578ab16fc9875c9a4668e63709&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From above analysed links we can conclude that the file creates keys, it
changes values in registry, it change only one file, creates process
called sample.exe and adds value to the modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The links do not show any way of disinfecting the following malware
file. My personal opinion of the above links is good that they can show
you that this file is malware, but still they do not show you enough
information. Which can help you for further instructions and actions
that should be consider. Not even providing you an information or links
which anti virus software can help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools for analysing the malware are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The malware file, contains characteristics of an identified security
risk. Possible security risk is Backdoor.Agent.AJU [Backdoor.Agent.AJU].
The threat category is network-aware worm and malicious trojan horse.
Its modifying file system, memory and registry. The origin of this
malware indicates possible country, Russian Federation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the reports we can conclude that most of the known anti virus
software has hit of this malware infection and it can disinfected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools for analysing the malware are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Anubis: Analyzing Unknown Binaries – &lt;a href="http://anubis.iseclab.org/"&gt;http://anubis.iseclab.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web tool that we have used to analysis three of random chosen files
are listed bellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we will compare each one of those service, what kind of
information they show, provide and do they supply with disinfected
solution, if so how, and why not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above table give as an perfect over view, which tool is easy to use,
provides enough information, disinfected information and gain the
highest mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to generalize that from the above information we see that
each online analysing tool has own means, criteria and different
information to distribute. On the whole, some of them were not that easy
and simple to use, yet they provide as with expectant information and
disinfected solutions. Therefore, our succeeder for this test
is ThreatExpert. But bear in mind that I have not measure and compare
all the online tool-kits for analysing the files, just the ones listed
in the previous section. For furthermore, please refer to the following
article that was publish in 2010 by Lenny Zeltser
[MalwareAnalysisToolkit].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, we found out that the chosen files are malware. Likewise,
can harm our computer in different methods. Yet we got an information
for some, for instance how to disinfected the computer. Therefore, we
made a comparison table to scale the best online analysing tool for
malware. Where total number is 6 tools, and different score rank. The
first one is TheratExpert, secondly is Virustotal.com and the third is
Netscty. Still all of mentioned tools score difference with one point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founder Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Macedonian government has announced to open a CERT agency.
This news was not only shock to us, but to everyone else, indeed.
However, we are supporting this initiative and hope that will be able to
elaborate and corporate within organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macedonian situation in a field of information and cyber security is not
on very surprising or signification level. Therefore our main goal is to
increase and merge the collaboration with neighbour countries as well as
with international organizations and agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, our belief lies that we will be able to bring better
understanding of very important issues that concern information and
cyber security, and to lead to better national awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this matter, our company will continue to expend the partnership as
well as international collaboration. We will constantly checking for
updates for existing solutions, also to search for new solutions to
update our offerings and services. And further development of our
projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first wireless telecommunications was established in early 20th
century, within successful transmitted radio signal across Atlantic
Ocean. And it was known as the first wireless communication across the
ocean. However, in this time likewise the computers were not widespread,
the inventors and developers of wireless have not had in mind that this
technology will be so spread and to carry out a security into the
wireless telecommunications. Whereabouts, nowadays computers are
worldwide spread in every home, in every office, and especially when we
are on the road or when we travel. We used them in fact as our main
devices to be able to complete and conduct our everyday tasks throughout
wireless technology. Such as, to share picture, media, use different
instant chatting application, video and voice calls – skype, etc.
Additionally, wireless technologies have been very popular recently, in
home and business users. Due to the fact that it is costs-effective,
useful, no mess cables into the build or house, it is easy to set up,
and it provides a great mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owing to the expansibility, mobility and usability, the wireless
technology and telecommunication could be at great risk. Therefore, in
this article we will introduce the readers within the different
categories coverage range wireless networks. Then we will go over the
wireless standards, as well as the most commonly known security threats.
Last but not least, we will introduce the readers with the basic
wireless security measures. And finally we will summarise the article
with the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wireless Network&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wireless network it is used to transport data between devices and among
devices. They are often categorized into three groups based on the
coverage range, such as: Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN), WLANs, and
Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN). Where WWAN it involves wide
coverage area of technologies, such as, Global System for Mobile
Communication (GSM), 2G cellular, and many other. In the other hand,
WLAN unlike the traditional wired network does not need cables, it
connects computers and other parts to the network using an access point
device, and it has coverage areas of up to 300 feet. In contrast the
WLAN, the WPAN is representing the wireless personal area network
technologies such as Bluetooth and Infra-Red. Please note that these
technologies receive and send information using electromagnetic waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wireless Standards&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wireless technologies comply with a variety of standards and offer
different levels of security features. The advantages of standards are
to encourage mass production, as well as to allow products from
different vendors to interoperate. For this article we have limited the
discussion to the most commonly known IEEE 802.11 and the Bluetooth
standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the two standards are described below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IEEE 802.11 standard. Are first developed in 1997. It is designed to
    support medium range, higher data rate for applications, for
    instance, Ethernet networks and to mobile address and portable
    stations. In addition, WLAN standards are designed for 1 Mbps to 2
    Mbps wireless transmissions. Hence advanced support it was followed
    in 1999 by 802.11a, then by 802.11b standard, where the later on the
    security vulnerabilities of the standard have been exposed. Another
    standard still in draft has been developed – 802.11g, yet the
    massive WLAN productions now are based on the 802.11b standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth standard. It is an ad-hoc network standard. Are designed
    owing to interconnect different types of devices between each
    other’s, such as computers, mobile phones, PDAs, etc. Their
    applications include wireless synchronization, e-mail, internet
    access using personal computer connections, hands free headsets and
    car kits, and many others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wireless Security Threats&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the effect of that the wireless networks are widely spread and they
are available around us it represents the potential treats in wireless
network. Also the security threats could be made from errors and to
personal privacy. However, the most commonly known concerns in wireless
security are devices theft, vulnerabilities, denial of service attacks,
malicious code and hackers, services theft and foreign and industrial
espionage. Moreover, authorized and unauthorized access of the wireless
device may commit fraud and theft. As well as, malicious hackers may
break into a network without authorizations, by exploiting the
vulnerability, by brute forcing the password or other security
vulnerability flow to do hard or to gain personal information or needs.
In addition, malicious hackers or crackers are usually people from
outside of an organization or agency. Conversely, users within
organization and agency are a threat as well. Furthermore, they could
gain access to the wireless access point by eavesdropping on wireless
device communication. Additionally, malicious code includes such as,
worms, Trojan horses, viruses, or other unwanted code, application that
are designed for purpose to damage files or bring down the system or the
entire network. Service theft is when for instance an unauthorized user
gains access to the network and in worst case customer data or network
resources. And last, foreign and industrial espionage covers gathering
data from corporation or intelligence information from government.
Especially in wireless network espionage is very simple because the
transmission of data is across radio waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wireless Security Measures&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the previous paragraph we can conclude that actually wireless
network it has different approaches and methods of threats. Therefore,
in this section we will concentrate of how to apply security measures in
our wireless network, either are for a personal or organizational usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First step is to create a Security Policy. It defines what it means to
be secure, as well as includes restrictions on wireless LAN functions,
traffic, flow, and access. Second is to configure for Secured Network
Access, by implementing and configuring setup password protection, also
to physically secure the WLAN and to secure the WLAN. It can be secured
from intruders by wireless authentication, such as: WEP (Wired
Equivalency Privacy) – which can be hacked very easily); WPA and WPA2
(Wi-Fi Protected Access) – are more secure alternatives, where unlike
the WEP and WPA, WPA uses the AES (Advance Encryption Standard) and it
supports two modes of authentication – WPA2-PSK (Pre-shared key) and
WPA2-Enterprise (EAP/RADIUS) mode. Thirdly by controlling wireless
visibility by Service Set Identifier (SSID), this is visible and real
name of the wireless network. Last but not least, by securing the
network with virtual segmentation, called Virtual LAN. Finally, we
recommend on-going security maintenance and continue education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today wireless networks are helping and definitely providing the
opportunity to the organizations, individuals and business to cut costs,
to increase the productivity and mobility. By following the above
recommended security measures the everyday work will in fact continue
without any interference. The key to keep up and creating a security
wireless network is on-going running business and organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the 25 of June 2012, the Macedonian website of Ministry of
Interior (MVR) was defaced by Kosovo Network Security (KNS) group, below
figure. However, after we have noticed and some of the social networking
sites have informed me, I was concern to find out what just have
happened …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Purpose&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the 25 of June 2012, the Macedonian website of Ministry of
Interior (MVR) was defaced by Kosovo Network Security (KNS) group, below
figure. However, after we have noticed and some of the social networking
sites have informed me, I was concern to find out what just have
happened and how did happen, and of course how they have done it. So for
this purpose, I have done some digging into details, about the previous
defacement activities of this very important government site. But before
we continue with more details, let just talk about the situation of
yesterday and what did the authorities take protective measures steps
and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, 25 June 2012 at 19:38, one friend have updated his status in
one of the social networking sites, as follows: “Хакован
&lt;a href="http://mvr.gov.mk/"&gt;http://mvr.gov.mk/&lt;/a&gt;” (Hacked &lt;a href="http://mvr.gov.mk/"&gt;http://mvr.gov.mk/&lt;/a&gt;). And it made me
extremely intrigue to see what actually have just happened. The below
figure, displays the message spread from the KNS group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screenshot from the mvr.gov.mk defaced version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, what makes the situation even more interesting is that after
the report that the site was defaced the authorities have taken a
measures steps to fix the issue, by either shutting down the server or
restoring the content of the site from the backup. Then after one or two
minutes the site was defaced again. I did not want to lose the time and
the nervous to check every five or ten minutes to see when it will be
back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, after 15 hours, or one stressful – hard core night for the
administrators of the site, the usability and functionalities where back
as normal, let just see how long will stay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the current post the idea is to give and overview, of what
actually is going on when it comes to case of cyber space, cyber
security issues in Macedonia. The structure of this post is introduces
first with the issue, or the problem that actuality made me to write
this post. Followed by the background investigation about the previous
defacement activities on the Ministry of Interior website in Macedonia.
Then with the background investigation about the KNS group, moreover,
with the self pen-testing site with different attacking methodologies.
And finally, closing by with a conclusion and action plan that should be
taken, for hence actions. This post does not only involves the public
sector, but even and the private sector too. Those agencies,
organizations are too much careless and do not take any actions of
securing their IT assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministry of Interior in Macedonia site offers different online services.
The site primary idea is to inform the inhabitance about the news,
actions, useful information, public relations, analysis and statistics;
international cooperation and legislation; and finally the services. And
secondly is to give and opportunities to the population scheduling of
service, if their document is issued, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one short sentence, this site, for some people, it may be very useful
or not. However, I need to empathize that the site is only available in
Macedonian language, nor Albania, nor English version. So, in simple
conclusion this site is only useful for Macedonian speakers, and not for
foreigners, yet still represents one of very important public service,
government agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in the next section we will discuses the previous
defacement and hacking attacks of this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service of this site, or the domain first was registered in 22
October 2003, and unfortunate I do not remember when was first time
available and published. However, in the pass years I have heard many
times that this site was defaced and hacked, but still no actions or
results were shown. Therefore, it made me very interesting to find out,
if this defacement activities where notified and when and how many
where. For this purpose I have use a site service that I know few years
ago, the &lt;a href="http://www.zone-h.org/"&gt;Zone-H&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover,
&lt;a href="http://www.zone-h.org/"&gt;Zone-H&lt;/a&gt; is neither responsible for the reported
computer crimes nor it is directly or indirectly involved with them, it
is just and simple site where collects the cybercrime activities
notified anonymously. The bellow figure provides a details of previous
reported/notified cybercrime activities of MVR site in Macedonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In details, total notifications are 4 of which 2 are single IP and 2 are
mass defacements. The first mass defacement was done in 29 July 2009,
when the site use a OS: Windows 2000, then in 2011 it was the
re-defacement and the server operating system is Windows 2008. Followed
by the other massive defacement in this year 2012 in March 18, and same
year, few days before the current attack, 22 of June it was
re-defacement. And the attack, defacement that we write for it was not
notified or reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these data, and schedule, we can come to a conclusion that the site
was defaced just 3 days before the mass defacement attack, so it might
be a simple warning, to taken an action before something goes really
wrong. But most probably, non of those administrators, or authorities
did not taken any serious actions, until the case yesterday appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Details&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to do an analysis of what actually have happened, we need to
take some actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we have done a simple web sniffer, to find out what kind of
system, and services the site, server is using. If we request the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields"&gt;HTTP
Request Header&lt;/a&gt;
we will receive an HTTP Response Header with a following data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    Status: HTTP/1.1 200 OKCache-Control: privateContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.0Set-Cookie: ASP.NET_SessionId=3lti3gep3usg4255ggf34tjn; path=/; HttpOnlyX-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727X-Powered-By: ASP.NETDate: Tue, 26 Jun 2012 08:18:34 GMTConnection: closeContent-Length: 103773

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above data, is useful in a sense that provides as an information
about the Server and the ASP.Net Version. Then, if we want to find more
details about the open and close ports and operating system we can use
the &lt;a href="http://nmap.org/"&gt;nmap&lt;/a&gt; tool with the following command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nmap -O -v IP-Address&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the results will be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    PORT STATE SERVICE21/tcp open ftp80/tcp open httpRunning (JUST GUESSING) : Microsoft Windows Vista|2008|7 (89%)

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the web sniffing and from the OS version scanning we can assume
that the server is running Microsoft Windows 2008. The current
vulnerabilities and possible exploitations are visible on the &lt;a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/"&gt;Microsoft
Security
Bulletins&lt;/a&gt;
website. By knowing the vulnerabilities it is very easy task to find out
a way either to commit DoS attack or remote server access. However, in
this post we will not go into details and exploitation descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the KNS, we assume the domain is followed:
&lt;a href="http://kns-team.com/"&gt;http://kns-team.com&lt;/a&gt;. However, the site is down,
therefore, we will have to understand who is behind this domain
registration. Therefore, we will use the whois database to understand
more, or even we can use another site that have been defaced by this
group to find out more. So there is the list presented the members in
the groups and their archive of notified defaced sites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zone-h.org/archive/notifier=cracker-besi"&gt;rAcKeR-BeSi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zone-h.org/archive/notifier=L0wHacker"&gt;L0wHacker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sLizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X-r00t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SpyHackz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Facebook fan page is:
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kosova-Network-Security/176195849098989"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kosova-Network-Security/176195849098989&lt;/a&gt;.
For more info I was short of time to do more digging, but I hope that
someone will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Action&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After understanding the details about the MVR site, operating system and
their server services, and information about the KNS, it is time to take
an action of trying to see how vulnerable is MVR site, and to see if
these lads had very difficult time of defacing the content of the site,
or even gaining access to the server-side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before, we carry on, I want to stress out that this section is not
to give you an idea how, or knowledge to exploit or use any
vulnerabilities to deface or gain access to the site. We will just
demonstrate you a very simple
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt; exploit of MVR
site that we have found a vulnerability, figure below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of exploitation by XSS vulnerability, mvr.gov.mk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore, from this very simple and easy exploitation of XSS
vulnerability of the MVS site we will be able to run more advance and
complicated shell scripts to gain access and maintain access of the
server. Our initial idea is not to show you how to do it, but to expose
to the audience that actually hence actions is need it. And we hope that
the administrators, developers and the authorities will take an action
of mitigating the risk, and further vulnerabilities of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Macedonia, cyber space, cyber crime, cyber security, cyber warefare,
cyber terrorism are actually unknown words, terminology. They are not
even specified or added into the Macedonian dictionary, nor in IT
dictionary. However, this is not the first or least defacement, attack
that has happened in Macedonia, nor the first attack that has been done,
implemented by neighbor countries, or someone else. I just don’t
understand why people in this country are so careless about how to
protect their IT assets, and everything else, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is not an issue that we do not have specialists to
conduct a pen-testing to the sites and services that not only the
government agencies are offering but even the banks and private sectors
as well. We even have a cyber crime unit in Ministry of Interior, and
one of very successful information security research and development
laboratory in Macedonia: &lt;a href="http://www.zeroscience.mk/en/"&gt;Zero Science
Lab&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the &lt;a href="http://cybersecurity.mk/icsap/"&gt;ICSAP – Interactive
Cyber Security Awareness Program&lt;/a&gt;,
Macedonia project, developed by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in final conclusion, I would like to recommend the
authorities to take actions about the above described activities done by
KNS and hope that the security awareness will boost up, and the further
actions will be considered of securing cyber space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this post is to introduce the reader with the security
programing techniques into deferent program languages and operating
system security models. The post is introducing four following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Session storage’s in Ruby on Rail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parameterized statements into Java with JDBC, C# with ASP.NET,
    PHP5, php-mysqli, Perl, Python and Hibernate Query Language (HQL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unix permission model, Unix ACL and Windows 7 security model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding all the security vulnerabilities in bash script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each topic will be divided into own section, where at the end of each
topic we stated the reference and additional reading material. The
source code, scrips and the additional task were given by the lecture.
However this will help the readers and people interesting into
programing for further work and involvement with the above topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1. Session storage’s in Ruby on Rail&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Session in Rails is a hash-like structure which allows you to store data
across requests. Sessions can hold any kind of data object (with some
limitations) because they store data using Data Marshalling.Session in
rails it is not a hash. Session creates new instant of session in every
time new user visit the site. Recommendation is to not store large
objects in a session and critical data should not be stored in
session.Rails way of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;implementing session is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;session_id is a 32 hex character MD5 hash based upon time, random
    number and constant string. It is stored in cookie at client
    browser. Rails provides transparent support for session_id.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Session storage discussed below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby on Rails provides with many session storage option:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PStore – it implements a file based persistence mechanism based on a
    Hash. User code can store hierarchies of Ruby objects (values) into
    the data store file by name (keys). An object hierarchy may be just
    a single object. User code may later read values back from the data
    store or even update data, as needed. The files that are stored are
    usually located in the tmp/sessions folder for the Rails app. The
    main downside of using the PStore is that you will have to do some
    session-pruning periodically because performance decreases as the
    number of sessions stored increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ActiveRecordStore – keeps the session id and hash in a database
    table and saves and retrieves the hash on every request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CookieStore – it saves the session hash directly in a cookie on the
    client-side. The server retrieves the session hash from the cookie
    and eliminates the need for a session id. Cookie-based sessions are
    just faster to retrieve and process than hitting the file-system on
    every request, were it was previously. Cookies are generally limited
    to 4K in size. While not an issue for most (proper) usage of the
    session, this could be a legitimate limit for some scenarios. If
    your application abuses the session, you’ll need to decide on a
    different session store that are available. The cookie has a SHA512
    fingerprint attached and is hashed with a secret stored up on the
    server and there are, however, derivatives of CookieStore which
    encrypt the session hash, so the client cannot see it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DRbStore – it store uses distributed Ruby to store a user’s session
    data. The performance is great, but it requires a bit more setup
    than the other stores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FileStore – This store keeps the fragments on the hard disk instead
    of in memory. It works well if you have a lot of file storage and
    have outgrown the MemoryStore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MemoryStore – keeps your session data in server memory. It keeps the
    fragments in your application’s memory, which can potentially take
    up a lot of memory on your server. It is used by default, but it is
    hard to manage and scale if your application becomes popular.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Ruby on Rail CookieStore is available only in edge rails.
PStore is the default option for stable release, whereas its CookieStore
as default for edge rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2. Parameterized statements into Java with JDBC, C# with ASP.NET, PHP5, php-mysqli, Perl, Python and Hibernate Query Language (HQL)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this task we will take a look at the parameterized statement API-s
and we will find out and document how much does each of them protect
against the following possible misuses of SQL statements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;String injection (quotes, double quotes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL statement injection (expression syntax etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out of range integers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blind SQL injection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Java with JDBC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    PreparedStatement prep =conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROMUSERSWHERE USERNAME=? AND PASSWORD=?");prep.setString(1, username);prep.setString(2, password);prep.executeQuery();

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no possibilities of string injection because of the filtering
the statements. It enables users’ input to be initially filtered
instead  of directly embedding it in the SQL statements. In this example
is that the each parameter is a scalar, not a table, where the user
input is then assigned (bound) to a parameter. It is a good idea if the
character range is limited. Another thing that can be done to avoid SQL
injection is to convert numeric values to integers before parsing them
into the SQL statement. Or using ISNUMERIC to verify that they are
integers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;C# with ASP.NET&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    using (SqlCommand myCommand =new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM USERSWHEREUSERNAME=@user ANDPASSWORD=HASHBYTES(’SHA1’, @pwd)",myConnection)){myCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue("@user",user);myCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue("@pwd",pass);myConnection.Open();SqlDataReader myReader =myCommand.ExecuteReader();...}

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The placeholder – @user and the hashbyte value of password @pws – has
become part  if the hardcoded SQL. At runtime, the value provided by the
querystring is passed to the database along with the hardcoded SQL, and
the database will check the Username and password field as it attempts
to bind the parameter value to it. This ensures a level of strong
typing. If the parameter value is not the right type for the database
field (a string, or numeric that’s out of range for the field type), the
database will be unable to convert it to the right type and will reject
it. If the target field datatype is a string (char, nvarchar etc), the
parameter value will be “stringified” automatically, which includes
escaping single quotes. It will not form part of the SQL statement to be
executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PHP5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    $db = new PDO(’pgsql:dbname=database’);$stmt = $db-prepare("SELECT priv FROM testUsers WHERE username=:username AND password=:password");$stmt-bindParam(’:username’, $user);$stmt-bindParam(’:password’, $pass);$stmt-execute();

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example to protect against SQL injection, it is used an input
not directly to be  embedded in SQL statements. Instead, it is used an
parameterized statements (preferred), or user input must be carefully
escaped or filtered. This example shows and parameterized
example/statement in php v. 5 and PDO database to protect from SQL
injections and blind SQL injections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PHP-MySQLi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    $db = new mysqli("host", "user", "pass","database");$stmt = $db - prepare("SELECT priv FROM testUsers WHERE username=? AND password=?");$stmt -  bind_param("ss", $user, $pass);$stmt - execute();

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same as above but this time it is used the vendor-specific methods; for
instance, using the mysqli extension for MySQL 4.1 and create
parameterized statements to protect from the SQL injection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perl&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    use DBI;my $db = DBI-connect(’DBI:mysql:mydatabase:host’, ’login’, ’password’);$statment = $db-&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;prepare("UPDATE players SET name = ?, score = ?, active = ? WHERE jerseyNum = ?");$rows_affected = $statment-&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;execute("Smith, Steve", 42, ’true’, 99);

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automatically “sanitize” input to parameterized SQL statements to avoid
the catastrophic  database attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    import sqlite3db = sqlite3.connect(’:memory:’)db.execute(’update players set name=:name, score=:score,active=:active where jerseyNum=:num’, {’num’: 100, ’name’: ’John Doe’, ’active’: False, ’score’: -1})

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is parameterized statement with an example of named placeholders.
Which insure to avoid the SQL injections and database attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hibernate Query Language (HQL)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    Query safeHQLQuery = session.createQuery("from Inventory where productID=:productid");safeHQLQuery.setParameter("productid", userSuppliedParameter);

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsafe example: Query unsafeHQLQuery = session.createQuery(“from
Inventory where productID=’”+userSuppliedParameter+”‘”); The example
from left it’s used prepared statement approach because all the SQL code
stays within the application. This makes your application relatively
database independent. However, other options allow you to store all the
SQL code in the database itself, which has both security and
non-security advantages and the approach is called Stored Procedure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;3. Unix permission model, Unix ACL and Windows 7 security model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this topic we will describe two security set-ups that can not be
expressed with traditional Unix permission model, UNIX ACL and Windows 7
security model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unix permission model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving an different permission to different users in the same group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read and write permission/access to all groups, which gives and
    access to the ‘private files’, and you can gain access through a
    root account by an unwanted user, which brings and complete breach
    of the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unix ACL- enabled permission model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the user has permission over the file, he can read/write and
    delete it, which brings that it is not possible to give ‘some’
    permission to the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACL’s are not very portable and are very hard to maintain. For
    instance good example is transferring of files with ACL’s between
    different of Unix systems is an exercise for brave person, even if
    the both file systems support them. Which brings a difficulty to
    maintain for existing files for instance backup, restore, copying,
    etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Windows 7 security model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a standard user you can perform an action that requires
    administrator privileges by the UAC(User Access Control), which is
    controlled by the Admin Approval Mode. It can be turn off and on.
    Every time when you need to gain an access of the administration
    privileges it will be prompt a dialog box to gain and provide the
    password for an access. Therefore in the medium settings with any
    malware could turn it off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the settings of the UAC are in medium mode not off, still brings
    an opportunity to being turn off by the malware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;4. Finding all the security vulnerabilities in bash script&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this topic we will find all the possible vulnerabilities into the
following bash script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

|                                      | &lt;p&gt;                                  |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should avoid temporary file, instead we should use pipes [2]. We
should avoid eval [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the double brackets, instead of single one &lt;code&gt;[[... ]]&lt;/code&gt; it is
comment on the script above [1]. \$REPLY can be used to read the
previous value of the dir and pattern variable [1]. We can use instead
of find, while read contracture (loop) [1]. Find – can be set with a
cycle, for or while to check the validation of the file and the
directory/path, also comment on the script or using
&lt;code&gt;“$pattern” /tmp/listing&lt;/code&gt; [1]. No sensitization of the input, the user
can put any value and therefore, execute any command to create another
command. As we can see above the script it looks like that it is
security vulnerable. If we want to implement the security in the script
we should implement the above changes into the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this post is to identify and analyze mobile malware file:
&lt;a href="https://sim.cert.ee/hw/mmc.jar"&gt;mmc.jar&lt;/a&gt;. Thereby please follow the
following steps for completing the task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unpack the file (hint – using zip on .jar)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;a href="https://sim.cert.ee/hw/jd-gui-0.3.3.linux.i686.tar.gz"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and
    &lt;a href="https://sim.cert.ee/hw/jd-gui-0.3.3.windows.zip"&gt;Win&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find code sending SMSes using ‘sms://’ URI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate short number used in SM.send&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally for compiling the code use the developing tool &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/"&gt;Eclipse
    IDE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we are going to analysis the Java source code after
decompilation. The accent is to find the code that is sending an SMSes
using the ‘sms://’ URL. After identifying the linking associated classes
we have to compile the code to move toward to final results of URLs. For
this purpose we are using the developing tool &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/"&gt;Eclipse
IDE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the results and the sent SMSes URLs are going to be presented
into conclusion section. Which will complete the task and will yield the
basic analysis of mobile malware file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;ANALYSIS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After running the decompiler tool we are examining and analyzing the
Java source code. Whereby on the source code on the class M.class line
343 we have found the following source code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    if ((i &amp;gt;= 35)  (SM.isSending != true)  (i % 6 == 0) (f &amp; count_query)) {  if (SM.GS()) f += 1;   if (f == 1) {            RS.L(rs);            RS.L("Slide");            rs = RS.j("Slide");            game = RS.L(rs, Integer.toString((int)(System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000L)));            RS.L(rs);   }if (f &amp;lt; count_query) {  game = SM.send("sms://" + ms[1][b], ms[2][b]); // sms://  if (b == count_query) b = 1; else b += 1;}

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above code is associated with the class SM.class. With the following
source code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    public static int send(String s, String s1){   if (isSending) return 0;      new SM(s, s1);   return -1;}public SM(String s, String s1) { success = false; isSending = true; this.destination = s; this.message = s1; try {      Thread thread = new Thread(this);      thread.start(); } catch (Exception exception) { isSending = false;}

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above code is checking if the message and the destination is
correct  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and if the message is sent. Coloration is more like the first public
static method named &lt;em&gt;send&lt;/em&gt; with the two string values of &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;s1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the above extraction was finished by JD-Gui version 0.3.3 and
JD-Core version 0.6.0 and using the menu bar for search, with the
criteria that will meet our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bellow are executable results presented, done by eclipse after
compiling the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    /0SIF|6XI8ULE|YNLD5QDA6WM|YJ90RL/+WPJDAFY2 DC3QJ/+3RKA/5YPA0MD-5QFDwhile 7375/88600168904|7202/65510006691|1899/FTEME 1283|8385/88600168904|1 162 333 494 667375 88600168904 //sms://73757202 65510006691 //sms://72021899 fteme 1283 //sms://18998385 88600168904 //sms://8385decoded367375 88600168904427202 65510006691481899 fteme 128354

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above presented results after compiling the code we have
identify the number of SMSes URLs and in addition the exact URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a world where nowadays for everyday work, communication, etc.
the most essentially tool is our mobile phones, smart phones, etc. We
used them for communication, sending SMS, playing games, checking
e-mails, social networking, bank transaction, etc. That is why today
there are hundreds and rising everyday mobile malware files. We need to
make sure what we are installing in our devices, what kind of games,
applications, etc. Therefore, this post will help for a people who are
interested to learn basic of how to analysis and identify malware files
for mobile phones. However, this is only a basic, and a good guide to
give you an idea of what kind of tools, applications you should have.
This task is done only for a Java source code mobile malware game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, from the above section we have identify the number of SMSes
that are sent and to what numbers. The total number of SMSes is 4 and
sent to the following URLs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    sms://7375sms://7202sms://1899sms://8385

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, mobile malware is rising and it is about to explode, therefore
users need education[1]. By delivering basic and advance mobile malware
security awareness program we will have less malware attacks and better
security policy into everyday mobile, smart phones usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this laboratory test is to make effort to attack server and
to deface website. Here is the scenario: your client is worried about
some stuff posted on a blog. They ask You to take care of it. They have
a throwaway “script kiddie”[Script …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;PURPOSE and SCENARIO&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this laboratory test is to make effort to attack server and
to deface website. Here is the scenario: your client is worried about
some stuff posted on a blog. They ask You to take care of it. They have
a throwaway “script kiddie”[Script kiddie] in a third world country, who
will mount the attack so You don’t need to worry about hiding the
attackers identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we need to devise a way to attack wordpress (default
installation) based site to render it unusable (page view times over 60
seconds). Attack resources: one PC with Microsoft Windows XP, a script
kiddie, internet connection of 2Mbit/s. In addition, server has to stay
down for two days and script kiddie has up to 1 day to set up the
attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For scenario above their three different proposals from the fallow
students. Each proposal is described in section Proposals and their
effectiveness, installation process and the evaluation of the efficient
use of available resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, easy solution for limiting the internet connection of 2Mbit/s
by Oracle VirtualBox configuration manager. Secondly, the bandwidth
capacity of the connection and their performance is measured by vnstat1
for graphs to display our utilization. The steps are vivid on section
Methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, providing measurement results with different proposals will
help us to identify the most beneficial proposal for above scenario,
declared in Conclusion section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, after each attack, test the virtual server environment is
restarted, because of the affective situation that server after attack
needs time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;METHODS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of requirements of our scenario we need to limit the internet
connection of 2 Mbit/s and to provide graphs that can help as with the
measurement results to conclude which proposals is more competent.
Therefore, Method 1 is describing the step how we limited the connection
bandwidth and Method 2 providing as solution how to setup that can help
you in measuring the speed and the bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For limiting the internet traffic of the server we have to do the
following steps in command prompt. The following solution is gathered
from Manual of Oracle Virtualbox, Chapter 8 [User Manual].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limiting VirtualBox – virtual environment speed of network interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    VBoxManage modifyvm "[name of virtualbox]" --nicspeed2 2048

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where you need to replace name of virtual box with real one, and specie
which network interface adapter you wont to limited. In the above
illustration is only second network adapter affected and then you set
the limitation, in our case is 2 Mbit/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, to make sure that the result have been effective please use
the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    VBoxManage showvminfo "[name of virtualbox]"

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results and information important to be aware refer to Appendix 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to install an application that will help us to gather a
visual graphs of traffic manipulation of script kiddie. The application
is vnstat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the server virtual environment in command prompt please type the
following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    sudo apt-get install vnstat&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step is to select which interface should be monitored and create
graphs. In our case is eth1, which is second network interface. For
furthermore detailed installation process please refer to the following
link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.4geeksfromnet.com/2009/04/graphical-bandwidth-monitor-for-ubuntu.html"&gt;http://www.4geeksfromnet.com/2009/04/graphical-bandwidth-monitor-for-ubuntu.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check if the installation process is finished please use your
browser, as shown in illustration 1 and on the address bar type:
http://192.168.56.102/vnstat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 1: Vnstat PHP interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;PROPOSALS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three proposals are following and described in each different
section and their results. The main measure goal which is going to grate
for kiddie script is: easy to use instructions, the most efficient use
of available resources and can the script be up to 1 day attacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the results will be provided with two different graphs in
period of 5 minutes attack and 10 minutes attack. Which would guide us
to compare which kiddie script has performed the attack more in force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first proposal and the installation process instruction:
Script kiddie uses a little program to connection flood the WordPress
installation! The program uses Apache autobench to take the site down in
seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guide for the scipt Kiddie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the program from
    &lt;a href="http://enos.itcollege.ee/~avein/anti2.rar"&gt;http://enos.itcollege.ee/~avein/anti2.rar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unpack and run AntiXakkerv2.0.exe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the address for wordpress site and press the button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above script did no run/work on the VirtualMachine Windows XP.
Therefore, from the same author we have other solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Download
&lt;a href="http://enos.itcollege.ee/%7Eavein/anti.exe"&gt;http://enos.itcollege.ee/\~avein/anti.exe&lt;/a&gt;,
save it on Desktop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Open Start menu, select run and type “cmd” into the box and press
enter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. Drag anti.exe file to the black box (commandline) , select the box
and type the address of your server ( eg. www.delfi.ee ) after the
anti.exe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if the address for your webserver is 192.168.56.101 type
the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    anti.exe 192.168.56.101&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press enter and the site will go down very soon :=) P.S. This is
    lightweight version tat doesnot use much bandwith and is targeted
    against a bug in apache server :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;RESULT 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After running the first proposal we can see that the script kiddie does
attack the server, but the server was reachable after a bit long delay,
but still we could access to the wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some results graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 minutes attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 2: Proposal 1, 5 min, traffic graph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 minutes attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 3: Proposal 1, 10 min, traffic graph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand the script kiddie did attack the server, but on the
other hand the server was still accessible. I’d like to conclude by
stating that the above script did not meet our needs, and it did not
stop, bring down the response time of the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second proposal and the installation process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You (Script kiddie) download the file from &lt;a href="http://share.ee/x49176f"&gt;http://share.ee/x49176f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will get an warning message, but you continue to download anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In chrome it looks like this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will get a warning but continue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will look something like this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert the URL to attack and define how long you want to attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will look like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script is basic vbscript that will overwhelm the server by as many
connections that are required to keep the server down for as long as you
define.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above script did not work on the laboratory performance, because it
had an code error. Therefore, for this proposal we are not able to
provide you with the result graphs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third proposal and the installation process is listed below: There is a
free and very easy Denial of service script written in PHP, called
Keep-Dead (Version 1.14). You can download it from the following link:
&lt;a href="http://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/imp/2011/03/Keep-Dead.zip"&gt;http://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/imp/2011/03/Keep-Dead.zip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is developed for a research purpose, but still we can use it for our
scenario. The good think is primarily meant for use via the terminal;
although it will also work if launched via the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unpack the Keep-Dead.zip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open in notepad or any other text/script editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On line #26 change the
    &lt;code&gt;$target_url = “http://www.example.com/wordpress/?s=%rand%”;&lt;/code&gt; to our
    targeted wordpress blog. We can stop even certain page or post in
    wordpres or use of &lt;code&gt;%rand%&lt;/code&gt; for a random value to be automatically
    generated for each individual request • You can change the maximum
    number of requests to be made on line #32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changeable is maximum number of requests to be made per connection
    #37, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After setting the setting of our needs save the file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And in terminal you need to run the following script:
    &lt;code&gt;php –e keep-dead.php&lt;/code&gt; or if you run a xamp or other webserver it is
    possible to run the script from your browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can terminate the script by pressing CTRL+C in terminal console
    or stop/close the browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information or video tutorials please refer to the following
link: &lt;a href="http://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/keep-alive-dos-script/"&gt;http://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/keep-alive-dos-script/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we follow the above steps we can perform our scenario 3 to make the
server to stay down for two days or even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There many ways to keep the server down for two days, this script for me
is kind of easy usable. In addition, the author had provide and more
details with following content: In addition of my proposal pls install
the following script:
&lt;a href="http://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-5.3.8-nts-Win32-VC9-x86.msi"&gt;http://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-5.3.8-nts-Win32-VC9-x86.msi&lt;/a&gt;
in the installation process in the section of Select Web Server you wish
to setup please chose Do not setup a web server -&gt; Next click on the
PHP small narrow down icon and select Entire future will be installed on
local hard drive (second option) -&gt; Next -&gt;Install&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results and graphs of the above proposal are demonstrated in the
next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the script that actually does the job and it keeps the server
down until the script is down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;RESULT 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test results are following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. 5 minutes attack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 4: Proposal 3, 5 min, traffic graph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 minutes attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 5: Proposal 3, 10 min, traffic graph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A case in point is that from the above graphs we can see that the server
does get more traffic and it does get attacked by the script kiddie.
Illustration 6, bellow demonstrated that actually the server is down, is
not responding any more to requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 6: Proposal 3, server down after trying to reach the blog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three points that we should consider and to see which proposal
was more accurate and it did the job that was required in the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I would like to start with rating from 1 to 5 each proposal.
Higher score present better results. Which is proving our destination to
hold down the server for longer then one day. The bellow table
demonstrates which proposal has succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;th&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;th align="center"&gt;
Proposal 1

&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;th align="center"&gt;
Proposal 2

&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;
Proposal 3

&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Easy installation

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;
5

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;
5

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;
4

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Server down

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;
3

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;
1

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;
5

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
TOTAL

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;
8

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;
6

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;
9

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the scoring rate 3 of server down is means that the server was down,
but after few seconds was retrievable. Where the highest score 5 means
that the server was not retrievable during this proposal test until we
shutdown or cancel the process of script kiddie. In addition, the
Proposal 3 due to a code error was not able to perform attack, that is
why it is graded with server down score of 1. Therefore, our winner for
this laboratory test is Proposal 3 with script kiddie Keep-dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next issue that I would like to focus is to the network speed,
tested with other tool bmon2 which manifests that the speed limit of the
bandwidth did not go over the 2 Mbit/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the above proposals are nice and good example to have an
view of how and with what tools we should perform script kiddie
techniques. How to shutdown access to a server. On the whole, it show as
how to use tools and methods of measuring the bandwidth of network and
how to limit the transfer in comfortable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIXES&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1 is connected with the Method 1, which highlighted points are
illustration on what information we should check, to clarify that the
virtual environment has limitation of the network interface. Where
Appendix 2 is for installation process of Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS and
wordpress, mysql installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the costs of nowadays
most known attack  DDOS, leak of credit card numbers, infected machine
and never the less sending spam for 1 000 000 (one million) people.
There are few points that should be presented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where did we discovered …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;PURPOSE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the costs of nowadays
most known attack  DDOS, leak of credit card numbers, infected machine
and never the less sending spam for 1 000 000 (one million) people.
There are few points that should be presented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where did we discovered the information (links or sources)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of source of communication we used, for instance: instant
    messing, ICQ, IRC, which contact we have gather the information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the prices for the above attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we must bear in mind that collecting the above information
it is presented to a numerous affected sources ( i.e. Website, news,
forums, IRC chat,etc.). By visiting the source can lead you to a virus,
trojan, malicious code, malware, etc. Which can damage your system.
Therefore, we are going to use virtual environment to find our demands.
In addition, we will use different languages and different search
engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction of report is separated by tasks section. Where each section
is presented with the source, communication type and the costs of the
service. In addition, in Appendix 1 we give the configuration of virtual
environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the conclusion made of all collected data will be concise in
conclusion section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;TASKS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following list is the numeration of the tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DDoS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit Card Numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infected Machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spam for 1 000 000 people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TASK 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source where we can find information about the cost of DDoS attacks are
provided in Russian most known [Hackzone] forum. This is the source will
give as more of the answers. But again be careful when you accessing
this site. It is on your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the following link we received an information about DDoS
attacks: [HackzoneDDoS]. With the following translated statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    The average price of service from $ 50 per day. Depends on the complexity of the &lt;em&gt;attacked site. Methods of payment accepted via WebMoney. The network is practically around the clock!Commands:http / https / icmp / post / syn / udp /Price:Day from $ 50Week from $ 350From $ 1200 per month(Prices may change depending of type and timing of orders on the complexity of the attacked site)Demo test for 5-10 minutes.Contact:Icq :20-**-29Inspections completed:hack-world.orgwww.xaker.nameforum.xaknet.ruMost of the DDoS attack service are around per day $ 50, here is an other source and contact details:Contact details Icq:22-**-327Icq:875-**3E-mail:anti**os@jab**r.ru

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above information is from the following link:
&lt;a href="http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/15608/"&gt;http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/15608/&lt;/a&gt;. Other sources that can be
found are with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the following links: &lt;a href="http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/16067/"&gt;http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/16067/&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/17187/"&gt;http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/17187/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we stated above that the price is from \$50 per day and it goes until
\$350 per month and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TASK 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of credit cards leaked in the web are numerous amount. The
prices are not that high as people expected. For card that comes from
European country is the highest price and for the other are much
cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here some information from the following link, leak from &lt;a href="http://www.hackzone.ru/memb/view/name/Support_BM/"&gt;Support_BM
Originar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;source is in Russian language, so for this report is translated to
English. From the source [CartNumber].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TASK 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays it is not hard to find an infected machine/computer. Because
most of the user PC’s are based with operating system Windows and are
most of them infected. I have try so hard to find infected machine
price, but until today, I did not come up with any good source.
Therefore, I would like if it is possible to add this source and discuss
this source and information with the fellow students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TASK 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spamming for one million people it sounds impossible, but still out
there someone is offering this service. Here is from Kazakhstan source
with the following information, translated in English:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, for 10 000 KZT = 67.45 USD and the amount of message send are 20
000 spam. Then the price for one million spam is 3.372.5 USD without
discount. The above links is from the following source [Rassilka.kz].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to generalize that from the above information we see that
for any service that we looked for, it has a price. Value that are
different in other countries and currencies. Yet, before you start this
research make sure that you are not using your local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, I have used an virtual environment to be able to collect all
the above data. Because the sites, forums, links, etc. are infected with
malicious code, or can be easily traceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, we utter gather as much as possible different sources and
different prices. Most expensive is the spam for one million people,
second is DDoS attacks and never the last is to gain an credit card
numbers from different countries and different price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

What are the most significant changes? What has remained unchanged?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start the discussion about the major changes in warfare from
antiquity to present day we will precede with definition of War and its
significant and remained unchanged changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WAR in its literal meaning is fighting, for fighting alone is the
efficient principle in the manifold activity which, in a wide sense, is
called war. But fighting is a trial of strength of the moral and
physical forces by means of the latter. That the moral cannot be omitted
is evident of itself, for the condition of the mind has always the most
decisive influence on the forces employed in war (Graham, 2002).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanity has wedged war since antiquity through nowadays for million
causes, national and religious freedom, hatred, grudge, human rights,
liberating the enslaved etc. But one principle in war has always been
present from the depths of history till today, that is, wars are fought
for one purpose only, conquest of new territory from which economic
benefit is to be acquired for the soul use of the conqueror. Nowhere is
this more obvious than in the armed clashes of the beginning of the XXI
century, when under the pretext of human rights countries are being
robed from their natural resources and air-raids are killing those whom
should protect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we met with the theory of war and moral principles, it is time to
consider changes that have occurred between the ancient and modern
times. The military of ancient Egypt had introduced the new technologies
of metal, where they used bronze in the Middle Kingdom as main weapons
source, after it changed to iron in the New Kingdom and all during the
Late Dynastic Period. The Old Kingdom soldiers were equipped with a
great variety of weapons: shields, spears, cudgels, maces, daggers, bows
and arrows. The New Kingdom carried spears, battle axes, sickleswords
(MdC transliteration: xpS – khepesh or khopesh) and daggers. After the
bowmen, either on foot or on chariots, had softened up the enemy forces
with a shower of arrows (Dollinger, Dynasties XVIII to XX, 2004), the
infantry would rush in, breaking their ranks with hand weapons, maces
with wooden handles and stone – later metal – heads, battle axes,
hatchets, clubs, swords, sickleswords and daggers (Dollinger, Weapons,
2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persian Army had only three wars, started from 490 BC until 478BC, the
army was very multicultural, were organizes in a decimal basis,
regiments, units and corps were grouped in tens, hundreds and thousands
(Drury, 2006). Officers were being responsible for ten men, another for
one hundred, one thousand and ten thousand. Heavily equipped with
weapons, which are: Thrusting Spear, palta, Akinakes , Xiphos, kopis,
bow etc (Wildfiregames, 2004).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greece war, first nine years of the war consisted of both war in Troy
and war against the neighbouring regions, where destroyed Trojan
economy, allowed Greeks to getter a large amount of resources. The
Greeks won most of the battles, but they still could not break the walls
of Troy. The weapons that were used in those battles were bows and
arrows. As for strategies the famous Trojan horse, when Odysseus had a
perfect idea to build a big wooden horse where inside will be field with
the soldiers, which bring and invasion of Troy from the Greeks (Rita,
2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Army of Macedonia was the army of ancient Kingdom of Macedonia. It
considers a grate military force where there were reforms constructed
from the suggestion of King Philip II of Macedon and then his son
Alexander the Great. The introduction was in innovation of weapons and
new tactics, along with unique elements combination of military
elements, which bring a great intercontinental empire (Ellis, 1979).
Philip II had implemented in Macedonian phalanx army separation which
one group were on a mission to conquer a city and the other to conquer
castles. Each phalangite carried as his primary weapon a sarissa, but
the phalangite were not the focal point for the battle, they have used
other forces like: skirmishers, range troops, reserves of allied
hoplites, and artillery (Hellenica, 2005).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rome in the wars had adapted weapons, armour and tactics of many enemies
they fought. Main weapons of Rome soldiers were Spanish sword – gladius,
it had two throwing spears, a large shield, body armour and a helmet.
They have also operated with the fire supported weapons, scorpios,
carroballistas, onagers. For a fest moves they started to build bridges,
so that the soldiers and the army can move faster. The army can march up
to 30 km a day. They were very evil, trained to stab a 5 cm deep wound,
after breaking the enemy, Romans tended to kill as many enemies as
possible and their cavalry pursued fleeing enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Rome the medieval Europe warfare followed, which was the war
of legal and acceptable justification, nobility (knights) and the main
force on the battlefield was a heavy cavalry, where the law of the armed
conflict was born. The second largest empire in human history was the
Mongol empire. Mongols army had the capacity to move up to 150 km a day.
The weapons of the army consisted of massive fire (bow) speed and
manoeuvres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wars of the XVI Century were mostly protracted and indecisive. There was
insistency on building a fortress that was very difficult to conquer.
The most important improvement is the side of the weapons with adoption
of light guns and gunpowder. Gustavus Adolphus had guns in his army, he
had 1 gun per 83, but his enemies had 1 gun per 2000 men. The main thing
was to build and modify the fortresses for safety and hard to conquer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World War I, sometimes described as ‘the war to end all wars’ (Creveld,
2000, p. 162), the strategies were based on first manoeuvre, and then
attrition. Forces and armaments were infantry, cavalry artillery, and
surface navy (initially); later – tanks, planes, submarines, chemical
weapons. The tactics were manoeuvre, frontal assaults, fortified
defence, artillery concentration (initially); the theoretical thinking:
seeking the way out of dead end, but not finding the means and ways. The
first known bombardment from the sky, using airplanes was by Bulgarian
army on the 16 of October 1912 at battle of Adrianople, where they were
captivated by the Turkish army. From the German newspaper “Geschichte
des Luftkriegs”, Militarverlag der DDR, Berlin, 1975, though the 1912
United Kingdom had 23 air planes, Russian – 99, German – 46, Italian –
22, Japan – 10 and USA – 3 air planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second World War, where the technology and the concept of the war were
getting bigger, developed into a prolonged and extremely deadly struggle
of attrition. The Germans invented the rockets (vau1 and vau2).
Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the first and only events of deployments of
nuclear weapons in the world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second half of the 20th century, after the valuable technical point, the
arms forward for an outbreak of terrorism. That means that wars are no
longer big and global; the enemy is no longer in uniforman in force. And
size is no longer as great as it was the enemy can attack from anywhere.
Therefore, no longer wars head-do met the two armies, but running by
partisan / guerillas. Terrorism is an unconventional war de facto, i.e.
anti-insurgent operation, i.e. counter insurgency. Which create the kind
of combat actions that are performed nowadays in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In the 20th century, has one goal, redistribution of resources, i.e. to
get to justify the need to test before the war for democracy and human
rights. Macedonia is the country that is inclined towards terrorism, the
early 20th century, April 28 1903rd in Thessaloniki, the boatmen of
Thessaloniki have committed terrorist actions against the capital of
Western Europe and Turkey, i.e. have planted bombs in the Ottoman Bank
in Thessaloniki, the main post office, and planted a bomb in a ship
(Sotros, 2004 December).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As can read above the changes are very drastic. Humanity is fighting for
the different purpose; starting from the antiquity to nowadays, not only
in weapons that were used and presented, but in the strategies in a
tactics and theoretical thinking. Therefore, there are no more battles
wars, people are grouping and they can embattle from anywhere, which
gives a content of the terroristic activities of the wars. Today the
humanity and the scholars should getter together to work around of the
problems and solutions for the future, possibilities of internet (social
networks, VOIP, IM etc.), net generations1, thus today it is the main
source of grouping the population for massive protests or any other
actions, which can end-up to a war or scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently the technology and science are rising, the possibilities
and the changes in an aspect of wars will change. For instant is Russian
– Georgian conflict in 2008 as a result of territorial attack and in
sequence with it there was an cyber-attack in progress2; or powerful
internet worm repeatedly targeted five nuclear industrial facilities in
Iran and many others3. Therefore, nowadays this actions and concept of
warfare is different, no more uniforms, battles etc. Warfare’s are
getting new aspect and new ways to approach through the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the responsibilities
for the IP addresses below and how we can make connection to them. IP
addresses are randomly chosen by the lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IP addresses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. 69.163.171.238&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. 31.44.184.101&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the responsibilities
for the IP addresses below and how we can make connection to them. IP
addresses are randomly chosen by the lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IP addresses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. 69.163.171.238&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. 31.44.184.101&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. 188.72.228.69&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External IP that is used for purpose of this test is following:
193.40.244.0/255 1. The ISP that provides this network is EENet2.
Organization that is behind is Tallinn Technical University, Estonia.
City location is Tallinn and the region is Harjumaa. The phone number of
my ISP is: +372 73&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;*&lt;/em&gt;. The e-mail we should report abuse are: first
persons that is in charge: Viktor Borisevitch (e-mail:&lt;/strong&gt;tor at cc.ttu.ee
and phone number: +372-2-&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;*46) and Andres Lepp (e-mail: l&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at
cc.ttu.ee and phone number: +372 6 &lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;55). In addition, if we wont to
submit an abuse we should use both persons of network administration and
then we can submit and security incident on the following ISP e-mail:
turvas@eeenet.ee [RIPE NCC].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, Method 1 and Appendix 1 describes the website, tools and
application that are used to conduct this laboratory report. In
addition, Method 2 and Appendix 2 will introduce website tools and
databases where we can check if following IP’s have been reported before
as abuse and security risk. Both methods are represented with answer and
consequences confront in the result section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the conclusion made of all collected data will be concise in
conclusion section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;METHODS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First method describes and demonstrates web tools that have been used to
collect the needed information from the stated IP’s addresses. Second
method is pointing out website tools and databases that can be applied
if the IP has been reported previously as a abuse, spam or security
threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we need to collect as much as we can details about the IP
address. In Appendix 1 is showing the wholly information of the IP’s,
contact details, organization name, address, location, state, country,
technicians contact, abuse phone number, abuse e-mail, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the location of IP we should make sure that not only we
know the ISP or abuse contact details, but we should know national CERT
3 agency that is in charge too. Therefore, to collect the information we
have used different web sites, agencies: [RIPENCC, LACNIC, AfriNIC,
APNIC, ARIN]. The above reference are agencies collected from IANA4.
Authority responsible for global coordination of the Internet Protocol
addressing systems [IANA].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to have more details about the route of the IP’s we are using
command prompt in Windows 7 with the following command, where the
results are presented in Appendix 2 section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    tracert [0.0.0.0]To illustrate, the details information are presented in Result 1 section.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we have collected the wholly information about the concrete IP
proposals, we should check if in addition those IP’s previously have
been reported as abused, spam or security threat. To complete the
following method we need to check concrete database system that is
offering following service. First that crossed on web is [MalwareURL]
which is dedicated to fighting malware, trojans and a multitude of other
web-related threats. In addition, we can check if the IP addresses are
listed in anti-spam databases. With other words blacklist check
[MyIPAddress].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results from Method 1 are presented in Result 1, further Method 2 is
presented in Result 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;RESULT 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each IP are presented only the most important data details that we
need to collect for our goal. In addition, full description and details
are presented in Appendix 1. The tables bellow are illustrating the most
important information that we should look-for. In addition, the
highlighted lines are indicating the abuse e-mail box that should be
send mail too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    69.163.171.238OrgName: New Dream Network, LLCAddress: 417 Associated Rd.Address: PMB #257City: BreaStateProv: CAPostalCode: 92821Country: US#technician in chargeOrgTechName: Nagel, MarkOrgTechPhone: +1-714-706-4182OrgTechEmail: mna47-arin at dreamhost.com#abuse in chargeOrgAbuseName: DreamHost Abuse TeamOrgAbusePhone: +1-714-706-4182OrgAbuseEmail: abuse&amp;nbsp; at dreamhost.comTable 131.44.184.101person: Chris Burnsaddress: Building 4&gt;address: City West Office Parkaddress: Gelderd Roadaddress: Leeds LS12 6LXaddress: Englandphone: +44-208-901-2332#abuse e-mail: abuse-mailbox: abuse at laveconetworks.co.ukTable 288.72.228.69role: Mannesmann Arcor Network Operation Centeraddress: Arcor AG &amp;amp; Co.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, now that we know the abuse e-mail, phone number and contact
person details, still is this information enough for us. If we look in
details all of the IP’s are from different countries. Therefore we need
to find what is the national CERT agency contact details. First table is
based in USA, therefore we need to use their reporting system, which is
locate in the following link: &lt;a href="http://www.us-cert.gov/"&gt;http://www.us-cert.gov/&lt;/a&gt; . Second table
is UK, the national CERT agency link:
&lt;a href="http://www.ukcert.org.uk/"&gt;www.ukcert.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. Third table is based in
Germany, the CERT agency link: &lt;a href="http://www.cert-verbund.de/"&gt;http://www.cert-verbund.de/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the routing trace we can conclude that the first IP and the third
respond and it did not miss route trace, where in the second IP,
31.44.184.101 there is miss route trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we will run this IP address to Method 2. Despite the fact,
still we will run the rest of IP’s in the Method 2, to be trusted that
are not in the abuse list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;RESULT 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step is to attempt to search the IP address to check if they have
been previously report as a abuse, trojan, malware, security threat,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check and verify the security status we are using the service
available [MalwareURL]. Where results for 69.163.171.238 and
88.72.228.69 are with status that have not been previously reported as
abuse. On the other hand, 31.44.184.101 IP address is detected as an
security threat before. More details are presented in Appendix 3. Where
is demonstrating that the
&lt;code&gt;/404.php?type=stats&amp;amp;amp;affid=531&amp;amp;amp;subid=03&amp;amp;amp;iruns&lt;/code&gt; has been
reported as malicious URL and it is in a blacklist of Google, MyWOT,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that it is listed in the malware database list, but also if we
double check on service [MyIPAddress] that the 31.44.184.101 IP address
is listed in few blacklist which is assess by DNSBL5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that the concrete IP’s that we
analysis in this report are demonstrating the process and methods that
should be done in future to detect, report abuse, malware, threat,
trojan, security risk, etc. Where we should gather the detail
information, and to whom to turn the abuse. To be precise that are not
in blacklist, spam list, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of following IP’s: 69.163.171.238 and 88.72.228.69, from
performing methods and delivering results are safe and secure, still
think can be exploited in easy manners. The opposite, IP address
31.44.184.101 it has been already report infected as malicious code from
few blacklist providers. When checking the DNS, host name is linking to
UK company that deals with IP Transit. For further information please
check the following link: &lt;a href="http://www.laveconetworks.co.uk/"&gt;http://www.laveconetworks.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, hope that laboratory report and the analyse will help to
anyone else to guide them for future use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIXES&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1 is list of details collected from service. Appendix 2 is
trace route details. Where Appendix 3 is the result collected from the
black list database.&lt;/p&gt;
