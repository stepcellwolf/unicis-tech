Drinking beer and giving presentation why Drupal for me is a winner when it comes in CMS (Content Management System) security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used WordPress for several years, however soon as I got introduced to Drupal from my earlier colleague and a good friend I started to love it. It took me a several week to get to know the way how Drupal works, and the modules = plugins, views, content, etc. Soon as I've seen how easy is the setup, management and maintenance I felt in love from the first sight. Since then I will never switch to anther dynamic CMS solution unless is a static one, such as Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway sorry for any inconvenience but the video is available only in Macedonian language. However the presentation (html) format in the archive file below is in English version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to give any comments below or suggestions to improve the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
