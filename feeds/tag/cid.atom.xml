&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the event was performed from 30 of November until 3rd of
December by non-governmental, non-profit youth voluntary organization,
&lt;a href="http://www.cid.mk/index.php"&gt;The Centre for Intercultural Dialogue
(CID)&lt;/a&gt;. In the request to the organization
I was invited to deliver training-speech as an expert in the cyber
security to the above topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get an idea of what was the content of training I have provided you
with the slides below, as well as the pictures taken during training.
Unfortunately, the presentation slides are only in Macedonian language.
If anyone needs the content on the slides in English please fell free to
contact me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I would like to thank the organizers for the invitation, as
well as, for a great organized event and kindly words from the trainees.
The group to the panel discussion was very enthusiasts, knowledgeable
and experience to share and to give an interesting ideas for the hence
actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion from the discussion was made. As well as, that this is
just a step to bring the topic into Macedonia, and for the organizations
and groups to become more familiar and aware about the Hate Speech on
Internet as extremely important topic to be taken into consideration. In
additions, to emphases that in Macedonia is widespread in different
categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
