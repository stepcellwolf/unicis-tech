the El Bulli Hacienda Hotel near Seville, Spain. The event’s title
expressed its key question: what will Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
be like in the year 2020? (Harper, Tom, Yvonne, &amp;amp; Abigail, 2008, p. 8)
The report that I have read it is divided in a four parts; Part 1 it is
look back over the past 20 years or so; Part 2 it gives an outline how
does changes are transforming the nature of our interaction with
computers and the key questions that need to be addressed in the next 15
years as a result; Part 3 is concerned with HCI as a field of research
and as a community of practitioners and designers; Part 4,
recommendations, outlines specific suggestions for HCI in terms of how
the field needs to be change. Therefore, the research report it talks
about the future aspects and the future plans with an recommendations
that has to be concern in an aspect of HCI, I have chosen to write about
the part 4 where they give a good outline of the recommendations that
has to be encounter for the new actions in the future of HCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research report came with very good seventh future directions. Each
direction will be described in an educationally signification for me,
what I have learned and what should be the next future actions in
consideration. Matter of course, no one will know in what kind of
aspects and future plans the HCI will change, but still this research
report gives vaulting and most important future recommendations that
need to be considered, and there will be more and more recommendations
and future directions as the technology and the HCI changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start to talk about the recommendations in a field of HCI,
let’s see what HCI is. It is a term used to refer to the understanding
and designing of different relationships between people and computers.
In the late 1970’s the main concern was usability. Since then, HCI has
established and designed, developed and apply all manners to ensure that
the technologies are easy to learn and easy to use. (Harper, Tom,
Yvonne, &amp;amp; Abigail, 2008, p. 84)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting familiar with the terms and the practice of HCI let as
look though the main seventh future recommendations that were considered
by the scholars and people involved in this forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 1: Revisit research and design methods in HCI: it is
    a distinct research area, methods and techniques have been used have
    altered over the years. Computer system and technologies are still
    in a way of changes, thus are the approaches for 2020 that needs to
    be considered:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore new ways of understanding users. Over the last decade there
    have been techniques and design-based practices involving cultural
    probes. Usage of existing techniques of understanding that have
    emerged from scientific and engineering traditions, designs, views
    of diverse disciplines and cultural traditions; usage of conceptual
    analysis in the first stage of new HCI, where can comes from
    techniques of analytic philosophy and clarifying the systems of
    meaning and value of actions that are involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore new ways of designing and making. Designing and making it
    takes a very important influence in a way of HCI. It is very
    important to comprehend for what, which and why the system is going
    to be used, what kind of users. In the future lightweight and
    prototypes should fit the designing and engineering solutions
    together. Should be developed new technological, prototype tool for
    the future development, and consider a test of hardware and software
    within every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reconsider how to evaluate digital technologies. Create a purpose of
    usage of the system, towards the, is it going to be used in everyday
    life in houses, working spaces or other environment. For what kind
    of usability the system is going to be used. For all should be made
    evaluation tools to reconsider the criteria and techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 2: Be explicit about the remit of HCI. How far or
    whether the HCI as a research area should continue extend itself, or
    should be involved with interaction between people and digital
    technology, and should with concern itself more than in the past?
    Does are the question that should be raised. It should develop new
    design possibilities, future altering and crafting the landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 3: Develop disciplinary techniques that allow HCI to
    collaborate with other research communities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disciplinary exchange. Requirement for HCI researchers to know how
    to converse with disciplines with very different traditions, they
    need to understand what philosophers can do and why philosophy is
    important. Example: economists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beyond interdisciplinary boundaries. HCI should ask what might be
    the appropriate models for allowing interdisciplinary investigations
    to happen and it is an area where investment in research theories
    and approaches, in the elements of HCI competence and skill, and in
    the foundations of the philosophy of science are required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 4: Teach HCI to the young. Children should be
    introduced to the ‘properties and possibilities of computing’ it is
    the only way that they develop sufficient understanding of computing
    to enable them to be fully computer-literate when they are adults,
    and help them to shape the world in relation to technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 5: More advanced training for future HCI researchers.
    HCI professionals need to move outside of the scientific community
    they have lived within and find ways to engage with society as a
    whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 6: Engage with government, policy and society. More
    better technical and economical approach, where there will be wide
    range of implementing HCI in a government, but in policy and
    society. HCI should have a strong links with the society, it needs
    to interact more, not only like for policy in a trust and security
    in computer systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation 7: Offer an inclusive future in 2020. By 2020, HCI
    will need to be able to design for and support differences in human
    value, irrespective of the economic means of those seeking those
    values. In this way, the future can be different and diverse because
    people want it to be. (Harper, Tom, Yvonne, &amp;amp; Abigail, 2008, pp.
    78-83)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this article very interesting, not only in an aspect of human
interaction with computers but with the actions that were taken and the
propositions that were sum. I love to make a summer of the entire
research paper, but because of the short time period I could not make
it. Still I gained my knowledge what should be expected and where are
burrows in HCI field. It gives me a perfect view for the future
implementation of projects, aspects and techniques that can be used.
Hope that this few years since the 2007, the implementation and
recommendation directories have been successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
