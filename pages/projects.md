# Study and Improvement of Risk Assessment Techniques

Following research activities are part of a post-master education in EURECOM for two semesters, one project per semester. First, we conduct research about the cyber risk aiming at stating a problem for risk assessment and perform large-scale analysis prediction techniques (finite-time singularity models) on dataset collected by Verizon Enterprise Risk and Incident Sharing Framework, called VERIS.

The latter research was conducted and coached by Professor *Thomas Maillart*, from the UC Berkeley School of Information, USA. The research examines how vulnerabilities are distributed within more than 105.000 publicly available security advisories collected from Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB). Having the dataset, we select the top 10 vendors and perform time scale analysis and present the rank order distribution analysis of vulnerabilities attributes, such as: disclosure date, software vendor, classification and severity.


**Note**: Soon there will be Github available repository, sorry for inconvenience.
