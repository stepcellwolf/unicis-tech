[My Vita ->](/pages/cv.html) 

Much of my [research]({filename}/pages/publications.md) has been about cyber security as part of national security awareness, risk assessment, identity/risk management, cyber risk, cyber-insurance, cyber security awareness, socio-technical aspects and hacktivist. My current work focuses on the cyber risk and cyber insurance, defining correlation between threats vs. vulnerabilities, and likelihood of impact loss. I’m also interested in techniques and methods for data analysis and data science / mining.

Moreover, for everyday tasks usually I use: [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/){:target="_blank"}, [org-mode](http://orgmode.org/){:target="_blank"}, Linux ([Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net/){:target="_blank"}) & windows 7, [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page){:target="_blank"}, [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/){:target="_blank"}, and many other open source software. Additionally I use for development and for data mining the following: [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"}, [R](http://www.r-project.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/){:target="_blank"} and many others.

I am very interested in photographing where I own Nikon DSLR, and skiing. Sometimes, I go to yoga class, DJing, and so forth.
