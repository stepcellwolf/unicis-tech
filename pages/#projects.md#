# Study and Improvement of Risk Assessment Techniques

The following project has been conducted and coached by professor
*Thomas Maillart*, from **UC Berkeley School of Information, USA**. In
this project we examined and tackled how vulnerabilities are
distributed and  analyzed within more than 105.000 security advisories
published until 19 May 2014. Based on this information, we presented
time scaling analysis, amount of software that has been affected with
top 10 vendors. And last but not least, we presented the rank order
distribution analysis of vulnerabilities by severity, and
classification. Therefore, within this mindset only suitable and the
chosen database is the **Open Source Vulnerability Database
(OSVDB)**. After having brought the data we need, we evaluated the
vulnerabilities among with their attributes.


**Note**: Soon there will be Github available repository, sorry for inconvenience.
